## VfB Stuttgart – Season Outlook and Model Update ⚽

A mid-season look at the numbers behind the VfB’s strong start and what the model tells us about the team’s evolving performance. ⚪️🔴

---

## 🧩 Performance Summary

The 1:0 victory over Heidenheim was less spectacular than earlier fixtures but reflected the team’s growing stability and efficiency.  
VfB currently performs well above last season’s benchmark, **+8 points** compared with the same opponents in 2024/25 — a sign of a maturing side combining discipline with balance.

---

## 📊 Model Insights

Not only VfB, but the entire league has seen fewer goals this season — though not uniformly.  
The VfB attack ranks **6th**, defence **7th**, and **home advantage** **10th**.

Expected total points: **53**, corresponding to an expected **6th place finish** — roughly aligned with last year’s Europa League zone.  
That translates to **+3 points** over last season’s outcome, and relatively in line with the projected season start.

---

## 📈 Trend

The gap to **7th place** has widened — Mainz, Bremen, and Wolfsburg have started poorly.  
VfB leads **Bremen by +6 expected points** (real +5 points).  
While fixtures so far have been mostly from the lower half of the table, the team converts those chances reliably and remains slightly above its previous-year trajectory.

## 🎯 Derived Targets & Δ vs. Last Week

| Target | Probability | Change |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 🏆 **Champion (1st)** | 0.0 % | ▼ (− 0.1 pp) |
| ⭐ **Champions League (1–4)** | 33.6 % | ▲ (+ 15.4 pp) |
| 🌍 **International (1–6)** | 69.4 % | ▲ (+ 22.4 pp) — incl. 7th place → 81.2 % ▲ (+ 21.3 pp) |
| ⚠️ **Relegation (16)** | 0.1 % | ± 0.0 pp |
| ⛔ **Direct relegation (17–18)** | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |

## 📉 Interpretation

The sharp rise in international qualification probabilities reflects a widening structural divide within the league:  
A clear **Top 6** group, including VfB, separates from the chasing pack, while Köln, Wolfsburg, Bremen, and Mainz lose ground.  
The next match is key to consolidating this advantage and maintaining VfB’s position among the European contenders.

## ⚽ Matchday 7 Preview: VfL Wolfsburg – VfB Stuttgart

| Outcome | Model Probability | BWIN Odds | Implied Prob. |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| ⚫️ Wolfsburg win | 37.5 % | 2.55 | 39 % |
| 🤝 Draw | 23.6 % | 3.70 | 27 % |
| ⚪️🔴 VfB win | 38.9 % | 2.50 | 40 % |

➡️ **Interpretation:** Model and market remain closely aligned — an evenly balanced fixture with slight momentum for VfB.

Still, it remains a match on arms length basis, as the momentum is balanced with the home field advantage and fundamentally strong opponent.

---

## 🔚 Summary

A controlled win, a solid upward trend, and a model that mirrors on-field reality. In particular, the defence develops positively this season; 
while the attack did rebuilt some of the lost scoring ability, attributed to the late transfer of Woltemade. This will be subject to further analytics in future.

The team’s trajectory remains expected on 6th place, the currently 4th place a result of the beneficial season start that was dealt to the team and continuous development of the team's skills.
