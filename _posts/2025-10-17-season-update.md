### VfB Stuttgart – Season Outlook and Model Update ⚪️🔴

A mid-season look at the numbers behind VfB’s strong start and what the model tells us about the team’s evolving performance.

### Performance summary

The 1:0 victory over Heidenheim was less spectacular than earlier fixtures but reflected the team’s growing stability and efficiency.  
VfB currently performs well above last season’s benchmark — **+8 points** compared with the same opponents in 2024/25 — a sign of a maturing side combining discipline with balance.

### Model insights

Not only VfB, but the entire league has seen fewer goals this season, though not uniformly.  
VfB’s attack ranks sixth, defence seventh, and home advantage tenth.  

The model projects a total of **53 expected points**, corresponding to an expected sixth-place finish — roughly aligned with last year’s Europa League zone.  
That translates to about +3 points over last season’s outcome, in line with expectations after a stable start.

### Trend

The gap to seventh place has widened — Mainz, Bremen, and Wolfsburg have started poorly.  
VfB leads Bremen by +6 expected points (real +5 points).  
While fixtures so far have mostly come from the lower half of the (projected) table, the team converts those opportunities reliably and stays slightly ahead of last year’s pace.

### Probabilities for each position (1–18)

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0.0 | 3.1 | 8.1 | 16.3 | 19.4 | 16.4 | 11.8 | 8.8 | 7.0 | 4.2 | 2.1 | 1.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 |

### Derived targets and weekly changes

| Target | Probability | Change |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Champion (1st) | 0.0 % | −0.1 pp |
| Champions League (1–4) | 33.6 % | +15.4 pp |
| International (1–6) | 69.4 % | +22.4 pp — incl. 7th place → 81.2 % (+21.3 pp) |
| Relegation (16) | 0.1 % | ±0.0 pp |
| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ±0.0 pp |

The strong rise in international qualification probabilities reflects a widening gap within the league.  
A clear top six group, including VfB, is emerging while Köln, Wolfsburg, Bremen, and Mainz (will) fall behind.  
The next fixtures will test whether VfB can consolidate that advantage and remain in the European mix.

### Matchday 7 preview: VfL Wolfsburg – VfB Stuttgart

| Outcome | Model Probability | BWIN Odds | Implied Probability |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Wolfsburg win | 37.5 % | 2.55 | 39 % |
| Draw | 23.6 % | 3.70 | 27 % |
| VfB win | 38.9 % | 2.50 | 40 % |

Model and market remain closely aligned — an evenly balanced match, with a slight momentum edge for VfB.  
The fixture remains open-ended, as home-field advantage and Wolfsburg’s baseline strength counterbalance Stuttgart’s form curve.

### Summary

A controlled win, a steady upward trend, and a model that continues to mirror on-field reality.  
Defensive structure shows clear progress, and the attack has rebuilt much of the lost scoring capacity after the late transfer of Woltemade.  
The projection remains around sixth place — the current fourth position reflects a favourable schedule and gradual development rather than overperformance.
