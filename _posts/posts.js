    "content": "\n\n### Expected value and variance — from natural catastrophes to the Bundesliga\n\nIn the insurance world, *expected value* and *variance* describe both the average loss and its uncertainty.  \nThese concepts are at the core of risk modelling — from natural catastrophes to solvency projections — and can be transferred directly to football.\n\nThe **static xG factor model** applies these ideas to match outcomes.  \nIt calculates expected goals for each team, separately for home and away matches, using a combination of league-level baselines (*League xG*, *Home advantage*) and team-specific factors (*attack*, *defence*, *home*).  \nEach factor remains **constant across the season**, allowing comparisons of structural team strength — a “static” but interpretable representation of expected performance.\n\n---\n\n### Model structure\n\n#### Expected goals\n\nFor a home–away fixture, expected goals are defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nxG_{\\text{home}} &= xG_{\\text{league}} \\times h_{\\text{league}} \\times \n   \\exp(a_{\\text{home}} + d_{\\text{away}} + h_{\\text{home}}) \\\\\nxG_{\\text{away}} &= xG_{\\text{league}} \\times \n   \\exp(a_{\\text{away}} + d_{\\text{home}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhere  \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nxG_{\\text{league}} &:\\ \\text{league baseline expected goals} \\\\\nh_{\\text{league}}  &:\\ \\text{general home advantage} \\\\\na_i,\\, d_i,\\, h_i  &:\\ \\text{team-specific attack, defence, and home factors (log scale)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n#### Model characteristics\n- **Static calibration:** factors remain constant over simulated matchdays  \n- **Transparent decomposition:** each component has a clear interpretation\n- **Added value:** the component bring additional insight, as not directly observable  \n- **Probabilistic logic:** expected goals form the basis for simulations  \n- **Cross-league compatibility:** the same structure applies to different datasets  \n\n---\n\n### Calibration example – Bundesliga 2024/25\n\n| Team | Exp Goals Home | Exp Goals Away | League xG | Home Adv | Attack (log) | Defence (log) | Home (log) |\n|------|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Bayer 04 Leverkusen | 2.06 | 2.05 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.37 | –0.17 | –0.04 |\n| Borussia Dortmund | 2.53 | 1.56 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.10 | –0.00 | +0.45 |\n| Borussia Mönchengladbach | 1.68 | 1.51 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.06 | +0.09 | +0.07 |\n| Eintracht Frankfurt | 2.34 | 1.55 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.09 | –0.11 | +0.38 |\n| FC Augsburg | 1.03 | 0.98 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.37 | –0.04 | +0.01 |\n| FC Bayern München | 2.99 | 2.59 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.60 | –0.44 | +0.11 |\n| FC St. Pauli | 0.58 | 1.02 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.33 | –0.27 | –0.61 |\n| Holstein Kiel | 1.43 | 1.48 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.05 | +0.42 | –0.08 |\n| RB Leipzig | 1.89 | 1.15 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.20 | –0.08 | +0.45 |\n| SC Freiburg | 1.84 | 0.99 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.36 | +0.01 | +0.58 |\n| SV Werder Bremen | 1.22 | 1.90 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.30 | +0.09 | –0.48 |\n| TSG 1899 Hoffenheim | 1.46 | 1.23 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.14 | +0.26 | +0.13 |\n| VfB Stuttgart | 2.02 | 1.67 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.17 | +0.03 | +0.15 |\n| VfL Bochum | 0.94 | 1.00 | 1.42 | 1.04 | –0.35 | +0.23 | –0.10 |\n| VfL Wolfsburg | 1.56 | 1.67 | 1.42 | 1.04 | +0.17 | +0.04 | –0.11 |\n| 1.

    "content": "\n\nBetting Basics — From Fair to Value Bets, and beyond\n\nLet’s start with some basic terminology in betting.\n\n  1.  **Fair bet** — Two players agree on a fair bet when the expected cash flow (or expected value) equals zero, and both parties share the same understanding of outcomes and their probabilities.\n  2.  **Market bet** — The expected value is slightly negative, as the bookmaker includes a risk and operating margin, even if both sides agree on the probabilities.\n  3.  **Value bet** — The expected value is positive — meaning your estimated probability of success is higher than what the market implies.\n  4.  **Sure bet** (arbitrage) — A bet that locks in a positive cash flow before the event even takes place.\n\n#### Romantic Ideals and Bookie Nightmares\n\nNumber 1 is the romantic notion — the theoretical “gentlemen’s bet” of probability theory, elegant but irrelevant in practice.\nNumber 4, in contrast, is the bookmaker’s nightmare: if discovered and exploited, it can unbalance the book and expose them to massive risk.\nBoth are fascinating in theory, but not where our analytical focus lies.\n\n#### Market Bets and Implied Probabilities\n\nThe market bet (no. 2) is the workhorse of both betting and finance.\nIn financial terms, its probabilities are called implied — and in theory, risk-neutral.\n\nSports-betting markets, while increasingly liquid, are still far from perfect.\nThere is no single, universal implied probability set — but odds tend to converge as competition enforces efficiency and margins become aligned.\n\n#### Value Bets and the Search for Edge\n\nThe value bet (no. 3) targets what we might call true or real-world probabilities — those that describe the physical world rather than the market consensus.\n\nMathematically:\n\nExpected Value = p_model × odds_market − 1 >0 \n\n(without loss of generality, per one monetary unit).\n\nIf we could generate an unlimited number of independent value bets, each with positive EV, then simply betting flat stakes would, in expectation, make money over time.\n\n#### The Real World: Risk and Variance\n\nOf course, reality is less kind.\nBets are finite, outcomes are chunky, and variance is real.\nEven a long-term positive-EV strategy can go through deep drawdowns if the distribution of results is lumpy or correlated.\n\nThis is where modern portfolio theory comes in — offering a framework to manage the trade-off between return and risk.\nIn finance, this means optimizing risk-adjusted return under a constraint on acceptable loss.\nIn insurance, it’s the same principle, known as risk and value management.\n\nYour risk appetite defines how much loss you can tolerate.\nFrom there, portfolio optimization — or in betting terms, stake sizing and selection — aims to maximize risk-adjusted value, not just raw expected value.\n\n#### From Value to Optimal Portfolio Allocation\n\nOnce we move from single bets to a portfolio of opportunities, the question is no longer if to bet, but how much.\nTwo frameworks naturally emerge as next candidates for optimization.\n\nThe first is the Kelly criterion, which prescribes the mathematically optimal fraction of capital to stake on each bet, maximizing long-term growth by compounding expected value while accounting for variance. It is elegant and powerful — but also unforgiving when probabilities or independence assumptions are wrong.\n\nThe second is the broader risk-adjusted return (RAR) approach, borrowed from modern portfolio and insurance theory. Here, the objective is to maximize expected value per unit of risk, under a defined risk appetite or capital constraint. Kelly can be seen as one special case within this family — a full-risk, growth-maximizing variant — whereas RAR frameworks allow smoother, more pragmatic trade-offs between performance and stability.\n\n#### Where Betting Meets Portfolio Management\n\nTogether, these methods form the bridge between simple positive-EV selection and true portfolio management — where betting, investing, and risk control converge.\nThey transform a list of value bets into a structured allocation problem: balancing growth, variance, and risk appetite — the very same challenge faced by traders, fund managers, and actuaries alike.\nEvolving the app in this direction is a natural first candidate for an actuary like me.\n \n\n---\n\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n\n",

    "content": "\n\nGary Lineker:\n“Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes,\nand at the end, the Germans always win.”\n\nThis quote says a lot about **soccer** modeling. It is a simple game — one goal equals one score — and both teams have a continuous chance to score during a fixed time of 90 minutes.\nThe game has a relatively low scoring intensity, averaging about 1.5 goals per team and match, with only small differences across leagues.\n\nOf course,\na) Germany just recently lost against Slovakia, and\nb) it would be pointless to write this post if Germany always won.\n\n**Ice hockey** is quite similar, with a key difference being the higher average scoring intensity, and a built-in regime switch: temporary player suspensions lead to power-play situations.\n\n**Basketball**, though, is fundamentally different. Yes, there is a fixed time, and while there is net play time — just like in ice hockey — the key differences are twofold:\n\nLimited time per drive, reducing the variation in the number of drives per game.\n\nA different scoring mechanism, allowing 1, 2, or 3 points per drive.\n\nWhat does this mean for a reinsurance professional?\n\nSoccer is reasonably close to a homogeneous Poisson process, which in reinsurance is used to model attritional claim frequencies in proportional treaties — for instance, personal accident with a fixed sum insured.\n\nIce hockey is already different. Similar to credit reinsurance, there are inhomogeneous Poisson processes at work that create higher intensities and greater dispersion — as seen in trade-credit aggregate stop-loss covers.\nThis can be modeled either via a Markov-modulated Poisson process or by a negative binomial distribution (with stochastic intensity).\n\nBasketball fits nicely to a compound Poisson model, the general workhorse of risk theory — used, for example, in pricing attritional losses in motor insurance.\n\nSo what do you think about **Tennis**, **Baseball**, and **American Football**?\n\n* Property per-risk portfolios (independent but with small correlated patches)?\n* Multi-layer structures like catastrophe programs?\n* Industry-wide insured losses from a defined catastrophe event exceeding a pre-agreed threshold (ILW-type)?\n\nI am considering branching off into different sports, as well.\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

    "content": "\n\n#### VfB Stuttgart – Season Outlook and Model Update ⚪️🔴\n\nA mid-season look at the numbers behind VfB’s strong start and what the model tells us about the team’s evolving performance.\n\n#### Performance summary\n\nThe 1:0 victory over Heidenheim was less spectacular than earlier fixtures but reflected the team’s growing stability and efficiency.  \nVfB currently performs well above last season’s benchmark — **+8 points** compared with the same opponents in 2024/25 — a sign of a maturing side combining discipline with balance.\n\n#### Model insights\n\nNot only VfB, but the entire league has seen fewer goals this season (basel load average -0.15), though not uniformly.  \nVfB’s attack ranks sixth (stable to start of the season), defence seventh (up from 11th last season), and home advantage tenth (down from 5th).  \n\nThe model projects a total of **53 expected points**, corresponding to an expected sixth-place finish — roughly aligned with last year’s Europa League zone.  \nThat translates to about +3 points over last season’s outcome, in line with expectations after a stable start.\n\n#### Trend\n\nThe gap to seventh place has widened — Mainz, Bremen, and Wolfsburg have started poorly.  \nVfB leads Bremen by +6 expected points (real +5 points).  \nWhile fixtures so far have mostly come from the lower half of the (projected) table, the team converts those opportunities reliably and stays slightly ahead of last year’s pace.\n\n#### Probabilities for each position (1–18)\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| 0.0 | 3.1 | 8.1 | 16.3 | 19.4 | 16.4 | 11.8 | 8.8 | 7.0 | 4.2 | 2.1 | 1.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n\n#### Derived targets and weekly changes\n\n| Target | Probability | Change |\n|---------|-------------|--------|\n| Champion (1st) | 0.0 % | −0.1 pp |\n| Champions League (1–4) | 33.6 % | +15.4 pp |\n| International (1–6) | 69.4 % | +22.4 pp — incl. 7th place → 81.2 % (+21.3 pp) |\n| Relegation (16) | 0.1 % | ±0.0 pp |\n| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ±0.0 pp |\n\nThe strong rise in international qualification probabilities reflects a widening gap within the league.  \nA clear top six group, including VfB, is emerging while Köln, Wolfsburg, Bremen, and Mainz (will) fall behind.  \nThe next fixtures will test whether VfB can consolidate that advantage and remain in the European mix.\n\n#### Matchday 7 preview: VfL Wolfsburg – VfB Stuttgart\n\n| Outcome | Model Probability | BWIN Odds | Implied Probability |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| Wolfsburg win | 37.5 % | 2.55 | 39 % |\n| Draw | 23.6 % | 3.70 | 27 % |\n| VfB win | 38.9 % | 2.50 | 40 % |\n\nModel and market remain closely aligned — an evenly balanced match, with a slight momentum edge for VfB.  \nThe fixture remains open-ended, as home-field advantage and Wolfsburg’s baseline strength counterbalance Stuttgart’s form curve.\n\n#### Summary\n\nA controlled win, a steady upward trend, and a model that continues to mirror on-field reality.  \nDefensive structure shows clear progress, and the attack has rebuilt some of the lost scoring capacity \nafter the late transfer of Woltemade, and relative to the league, remained stable.\nFurther player contributions will be added to analyze how exactly this was balanced.\nThe projection remains around sixth place — the current fourth position reflects a favourable schedule and gradual development rather than overperformance.\n\n#### Model background\n\nFor technical details and background on the simulation and calibration method, see the [`soccersim`](https://bvonboyen.github.io/projects/soccersim/) project.\n\n\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

Small models are humble apprentices.**  \n> The trick is to know when to learn from one — and when to rely on the other.\n\n---\n\n### **Outlook**\n\nIn the next posts, I’ll cover:\n1. **System Prompts and Role Separation** — how I structure `system_msg`, `user_msg`, and `style` layers for predictable output.  \n2. **Prompt APIs and Templates** — how Jinja templates and JSON schemas define logic before generation.  \n3. **Client/Server and Deployment Models** — running local vs remote inference, caching, and parametrisation.  \n\nTogether, these reflections form a blueprint for moving from *prompting* to *building*.\n\n---\n\n\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

How have market leaders adapted already?\n\nToday, advantage comes from *learning faster than the environment changes.* For GenZ, this thinking is even native; anything non-participative gets rejected. \nThat’s why I see **Purpose, Collaboration, and Innovation** not as management slogans, but as the *living system* behind modern leadership.  \nThis is particularly important in **transformations**, as I have often seen cracks appear in leadership models that are *rule-based, top-down, static,* and *obligation-driven.*  \nAlso, this spirit is key DNA of companys that aspire itself leadership positions, which became clear to me, when visiting Trek Bycycle Corporation a while ago.\n\n---\n\n### Purpose, Collaboration, Innovation — the interactive core  \n\n<div style=\"float:right; width:45%; margin-left:1.5rem; margin-bottom:1rem;\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/img/pci-cycle.png\" alt=\"PCI as a cycle\" style=\"width:100%; border-radius:8px;\">\n  <p style=\"font-size:0.9em; color:#555; text-align:center;\">\n    Purpose–Collaboration–Innovation: the interactive core\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n**Purpose** gives orientation when structures can’t.  \nIt defines *why we exist* — creating clarity, identity, and direction without requiring constant supervision.  \n\n**Collaboration** turns purpose into motion.  \nIt’s how people connect across boundaries, act with autonomy, and still pull in the same direction.  \nIt transforms compliance into co-creation.  \n\n**Innovation** keeps the system alive.  \nWhen purpose guides and collaboration energises, innovation emerges naturally — not as a department, but as an *organisational reflex.*  \n\nTogether they form a **loop**, not a line: self-correcting, self-energising, and built for coherence rather than control.  \n\n---\n\n### Why it works  \n\nThe **Purpose–Collaboration–Innovation loop works** because it’s designed as an *interactive, adaptive system* rather than a linear hierarchy.  \nIts **design logic** is based on feedback and learning — not static layers or plans.  \nInformation **flows** freely across and upward, allowing insight to travel faster than instruction ever could.  \n**Control** shifts from external enforcement to internal coherence: people act responsibly because they understand the shared purpose, not because someone monitors them.  \nThe **energy source** is intrinsic — meaning, curiosity, and contribution replace compliance as the primary driver.  \nIts **tempo** is dynamic and iterative; instead of waiting for annual strategies or project cycles, the organisation adjusts in real time as collaboration and innovation continuously refresh direction and action.  \nAnd the **outcome** is resilience through renewal — a system that learns, corrects, and evolves without needing to be rebuilt each time the environment changes.  \n\n---\n\n### A quiet warning  \n\nMany management systems still rely on **Mandate–Organisation–Culture** as their operating model.  \nClear on paper — but often slow, fragile, and detached from where value is actually created.  \nThey separate design from practice, policy from learning, and culture from experience.  \n\nThe alternative isn’t chaos — it’s coherence through interaction.  \nOne is easy to implement: you can write it down. \nThe other is hardly worth writing down — but infinitely harder to achieve, though not impossible.  \n\nSo the question is:  \n**Are you still managing in Mandate–Organisation–Culture models — or already leading through Purpose, Collaboration, and Innovation?**\n\n\n---\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>",

    "content": "\n\nWhat is artificial intelligence? Why the hype? How is it used?\n\n\nAccording to **ISO/IEC 22989:2022**,  \n\n> *Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the capability of a system to acquire, process, and apply knowledge and skills to achieve specific goals in a given environment.*\n\nAI aims to replicate — or augment — human cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, and perception. Over time it has evolved from **rule-based reasoning** to **data-driven** and **generative systems**.\n\n---\n\n## A Structure of Intelligence\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; margin:1.5rem 0;\">\n  <div style=\"width:100%; max-width:900px; text-align:center;\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/ArtificialIntelligence.png\" alt=\"Structure of Artificial Intelligence\" style=\"width:100%; border-radius:8px;\">\n    <p style=\"font-size:0.9em; color:#555; text-align:center; margin-top:0.5rem;\">\n      Structure of Artificial Intelligence — from reasoning to learning to generation\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n**Symbolic AI**, or *classical AI*, expresses logic through explicit rules — expert systems such as *MYCIN* or *Deep Blue* are early examples.  \n**Robotics** builds on these principles, combining sensing, motion, and planning — often enhanced by learning.  \n**Machine Learning** replaced rules with data patterns, from *supervised* and *probabilistic models* to *deep learning* — the basis for today’s **Generative AI**, capable of producing new, context-aware output.  \n**Hybrid or neuro-symbolic AI** blends logic and learning for *explainable* and *safety-critical* applications.\n\nThe current hype around AI is from generative AI being accessible and, at the surface, understandable to the mainstream. To give some credit, it also opens new use cases within applications, such as the LLM based Health Memo Generator.\n\nModern autopilot systems in aviation are among the most advanced real-world examples of hybrid AI, combining rule-based logic for certified safety with learning components for adaptive control—demonstrating how intelligence can evolve within trusted boundaries. This is generally accepted by every passenger entering the airplane; even by my son, with whom I watched plain spotter videos in storm Benjamin today.\n\n---\n\n## The Actuary’s View — AI and Quantitative Reasoning\n\nIn **finance and insurance**, AI is hardly new. Tools like **AAAccell’s HedgePilot™** — a *risk and hedge monitoring and advisory platform for FX exposure* — or my **Soccersim application**, combining *probabilistic modeling* with *supervised learning* AI supports professionals in applied analytics.\n\nLess controversial systems rest on the **pillars of quantitative reasoning**: **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **interpretability** — ensuring that **human judgment stays central**. But some methods spark fundamental controversy. Why?\n\n---\n\n## Responsible Use and Human Oversight\n\nThe real issue is not whether AI should be used, but **how it is deployed**. Implemented safeguards are essential; a simple baseline is **human-in-the-loop** — final decisions always rest with people, assisted by AI engines.\n\nAI can also help **validate and explain AI** — generating human-readable validation reports, surfacing likely errors, performing plausibility checks, or distilling complex models into key factors. Such *meta-use* builds **trust and accountability** in professional environments, as well with regulators.\n\n---\n\n## From Reasoning to Creation\n\nAI’s path from **rules to generation** mirrors analytical progress itself — *define, measure, create.* Its true potential lies in experts deploying this **general-purpose technology** to *domain-specific problems*, as **Prof. Charles-Albert LeHalle** remarked at *FX Trade Tech*. It continues a decades-long trend under one enduring word: **digitalization**.\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

Emphasis fell on **defensive organization, midfield pressing**, and **clinical finishing**; the 3:0 scoreline mirrored the balance of play and underlined Stuttgart’s growing structural stability.\n\n## Performance & Points Balance\nThe win in Wolfsburg was both **convincing and above expectation**. The model estimated a **38.9% win probability** and **23.6% draw probability**, corresponding to **1.40 expected points (xP)**. With three points actually secured, VfB achieved a **+1.6 xP overperformance**, a meaningful gain that reinforces its position among the top sides. After Matchday 7, Stuttgart’s projection stands at **56 expected points** and an **average simulated league position of 5.2**, consolidating its place within the European bracket.\n\n## Trend and Context\nThe development remains positive. The **probability of a Champions League qualification** has increased further, supported by **Eintracht Frankfurt’s inconsistent form**. The model portrays VfB as **defensively compact, offensively efficient**, and stable in shot creation and conversion. Markets tend to overweight **recent momentum**, while the model prioritises **structural consistency**; as the season progresses, this divergence becomes visible—prices move faster with form, the model adjusts more gradually via its new **learning calibration**.\n\n## Position Probabilities (1–18)\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16–18 |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 0.0 | 9.9 | 11.8 | 20.3 | 21.2 | 13.4 | 9.0 | 6.3 | 3.3 | 1.9 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.0 |\n\n### Derived Targets and Weekly Changes\n\n| Target | Probability | Δ vs. last week |\n|:--|--:|--:|\n| Champion (1st) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n| Champions League (1–4) | 42.0 % | ▲ + 8.4 pp |\n| International (1–6) | 76.6 % | ▲ + 7.2 pp |\n| incl. 7th place | 85.6 % | ▲ + 4.4 pp |\n| Relegation (16th) | 0.0 % | ▼ − 0.1 pp |\n| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n\nThese shifts highlight the **emerging separation within the league**: a clear top six with VfB well established, followed by Köln and Mainz already several expected points behind.\n\n## Matchday 8 Preview: VfB Stuttgart – 1.

The model stays cautious, still crediting Mainz with one of the league’s most resilient defences. Such divergence is typical mid-season: **market prices reflect form**, whereas the model weights **systemic team balance**.\n\n## Mid-Term Outlook (Matchdays 8–11)\n\n| MD | Fixture | p_home | p_draw | p_away | xPs |\n|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 8 | VfB – Mainz | 0.392 | 0.253 | 0.355 | **1.43** |\n| 9 | Leipzig – VfB | 0.407 | 0.234 | 0.359 | **1.31** |\n| 10 | VfB – Augsburg | 0.523 | 0.232 | 0.245 | **1.80** |\n| 11 | Dortmund – VfB | 0.550 | 0.198 | 0.252 | **0.95** |\n| **Total (8–11)** |  |  |  |  | **≈ 5.5 xPs** |\n\nThe next fixtures are more demanding—particularly the **two away matches**—lowering the expected average to **~1.37 xP per game**.

Weighting is **re-evaluated** as the season progresses and evidence accumulates.\n\n## Conclusion\nA decisive performance and a +1.6 xP surplus over expectation confirm Stuttgart’s **balance and efficiency**. While the market leans toward form and the model toward structure, both perspectives point in the same direction: VfB Stuttgart is **firmly positioned as a European-level contender**, with the **Champions League zone** within reach.\n\n---\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

    "content": "\n\n## VfB Stuttgart – a impressing display of depth, adaptability and foresight\n\n### Match Analysis (VfB Stuttgart 2–1 1. FSV Mainz 05)\nThe 2:1 home victory over Mainz reflected Stuttgart’s tactical maturity more than dominance. Coach **Sebastian Hoeneß** rotated ten new outfield players — a bold move that kept the team’s structure intact, sustained running intensity, and demonstrated impressive tactical flexibility. The setup alternated between **3-4-2-1 and 5-4-1**, built for a low-scoring, controlled game: compact at the back, wide on the flanks, and pressing only in calculated moments.  \n\nBoth goals followed this design: a **half-space finish by Chris Führich**, and a **vertical assist by goalkeeper Alexander Nübel** behind the Mainz backline, finished calmly by **Deniz Undav**. Not a spectacle — but a demonstration of system stability, patience, and control.\n\n## Performance Trend\nThe upward trajectory remains intact. The **Champions League probability** rises further even as all top sides continue to perform. The **expected-points gap to Köln** has widened to **+10 xPs**, and **to Mainz** to **+13 xPs** — a direct outcome of the weekend’s results. Mainz, effectively ruled out of the European race for now, saw its top-six probability drop below 10%.  \n\n## Model Insights (v1.1)\nThe model rates Stuttgart’s **defensive performance 6th in the league** (previously 11th last season). The improved structure makes the loss of Woltemade almost negligible in the aggregate model. Assuming Bayern win the domestic double, **seven Bundesliga positions** could qualify for Europe — giving Stuttgart a **93.9% chance** of international qualification under current projections.\n\n---\n\n## Position Probabilities (1–18)\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16–18 |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 0.1 | 7.7 | 15.3 | 22.9 | 22.9 | 17.0 | 8.0 | 2.8 | 2.1 | 1.0 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n\n### Derived Targets and Weekly Changes\n\n| Target | Probability | Δ vs. last week |\n|:--|--:|--:|\n| Champion (1st) | 0.1 % | + 0.1 pp |\n| Champions League (1–4) | 46.0 % | + 4.0 pp |\n| International (1–6) | 85.9 % | + 9.3 pp |\n| incl. 7th place | 93.9 % | + 8.3 pp |\n| Relegation (16th) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n\n---\n\n## Team Skills – RB Leipzig vs. VfB Stuttgart (as of Matchday 8)\n\n| Team | xG Home (Rank) | xG Away (Rank) | Attack (Rank) | Defence (↓ better) | Home HFA (Rank) |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| RB Leipzig | 1.94 (4) | 1.25 (12) | −0.09 (12) | +0.02 (9) | +0.35 (3) |\n| VfB Stuttgart | 1.71 (7) | 1.65 (5) | +0.19 (5) | −0.06 (6) | −0.05 (8) |\n\n**Expected Score (multiplicative model):** Leipzig **1.83** – VfB **1.68**  \nA narrow top-table matchup: Leipzig benefits from home advantage, while VfB’s defensive structure and offensive balance provide genuine parity.\n\n### Scoreline Frequency Matrix (Leipzig – VfB, 1 000 simulations)\n\n| **HG \\\\ AG** | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5+** |\n|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| **0** | 2.50 % | 5.10 % | 4.70 % | 1.90 % | 1.50 % | 0.40 % |\n| **1** | 6.10 % | **8.20 %** | 7.30 % | 4.30 % | 1.20 % | 0.80 % |\n| **2** | 4.80 % | 7.60 % | 6.40 % | 3.60 % | 2.80 % | 1.20 % |\n| **3** | 3.90 % | 4.50 % | 4.60 % | 2.90 % | 0.90 % | 0.40 % |\n| **4** | 1.30 % | 1.80 % | 2.40 % | 1.30 % | 0.50 % | 0.10 % |\n| **5+** | 1.00 % | 1.80 % | 1.20 % | 0.90 % | 0.10 % | 0.00 % |\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nA goalless draw is statistically unlikely.

    "content": "\n\n## VfB Stuttgart — A setback with learnings, course intact (RB Leipzig 3–1 VfB Stuttgart)\n\nThe Leipzig defeat is viewed with nuance. Spectators point to individual errors — the own goal and a goalkeeper slip — while acknowledging a strong first half and Leipzig’s superior individual quality. Mood remains optimistic with Augsburg and Europe ahead. The game idea earns praise, but the ask is clear: lower the error rate and time substitutions better to sustain the level.\n\n### Tactical analysis — Control needs variation\nStuttgart set up in a 3-4-2-1 (slightly more forward leaning than before), dominant early with intensity and short counter-pressing, controlling ball and space. Individual mistakes at bad moments — before and after halftime — plus missing rhythm changes reduced stability (and inivted counterattacks with \"bulls\" just waiting for their stampede). The left side was the defensive weak spot; over-eagerness contributed to the own goal. Structure was sound but lacked tempo shifts and surprise to unsettle Leipzig. The direction is right; the details need sharpening. **Bottom line:** control is good, variation is better — if you own the ball, you must own the tempo.\n\n### Trend\nA small setback without derailing the course. This was not a system break, but a top-level learning step. Structurally, VfB remains in the European race around **57 xPs**. The model continues to value structure over short-term form — helpful after a loss when the base remains intact.\n\n### Model insights (v1.1)\nThe updated read confirms **defensive strength (≈ league rank 6)** as the backbone and sees a mild positive trend in attack. In combined expected-points simulations, VfB sits **~56–57 xPs**, stable within the extended top five. Defensive consistency is decisive — now on par with Leipzig and trailing only the top trio (Bayern, Dortmund, Leverkusen). With season length, **matchday weights** increase for recent games, older evidence decays. The **calibration method itself is unchanged** (see section “Model & Calibration”).\n\n---\n\n## Position probabilities (1–18) — VfB Stuttgart\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16–18 |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 0.0% | 4.8% | 11.4% | 18.9% | 20.4% | 18.2% | 12.1% | 8.0% | 3.5% | 1.0% | 1.1% | 0.5% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.1% | 0.0% |\n\n### Derived targets (Δ vs. last week)\n\n| Target | Probability | Δ |\n|:--|--:|:--:|\n| Champion (1st) | 0.0% | ±0.0 pp |\n| Champions League (1–4) | 35.1% | ▼ −10.9 pp |\n| International (1–6) | 73.7% | ▼ −12.2 pp |\n| incl. 7th place | 85.8% | ▼ −8.1 pp |\n| Relegation (16th) | 0.0% | ±0.0 pp |\n| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0% | ±0.0 pp |\n\n*Season goal remains “Europe”.

    "content": "\n\nThe 3–2 home win against Augsburg triggered lively debate among spectators. While the result mirrors the overall game, VfB's performance was scrutinised: both goals conceded were traced to individual errors — especially for the second, where **Nübel’s risky pass and Karazor’s positional error** sparked discussion over shared responsibility. Refereeing decisions (penalty, VAR interventions) came under criticism, and Stuttgart’s goals were widely seen as “earned but fortunate”: one via VAR, one just over the line, one slightly deflected.  \nThe core takeaway from the stands: after ten matchdays, VfB are level on points with the successful season two years ago — **European qualification remains realistic.** That season also brought Dortmund as the opponent for matchday 11 - does history repeat itself?\n\n### Tactical analysis — Between dominance and discipline\nAgainst Augsburg, Hoeneß switched to a **4-2-3-1**, dropping the third centre-back from Leipzig in favour of an additional offensive role. With quick, mobile players behind Undav, Stuttgart aimed for more attacking flexibility.  \nAugsburg’s pressing was **surprisingly sharp early on** and situationally well-timed, but faded over time and never reached Feyenoord’s coordination levels — eventually resembling Leipzig’s intermittent pressure phases. VfB controlled ball and space (≈ 62 % possession), but at times struggled in buildup when Augsburg stepped high. Both teams showed **observed xG values slightly above average**, reflecting the tempo and open first-half phases.  \nConclusion: **structure and mentality are intact**. Most notable is VfB’s mental strength when trailing — the team appears resilient and self-confident. The balance between control and risk still requires fine-tuning, but the direction is right.\n\n---\n\n## Trend\nThe win against Augsburg keeps VfB **on target** and **moves the team back to 4th place in the projected final table**. With three actual points — **+1.18 xP over expectation** — Stuttgart consolidates its position in the upper tier.  \nThe overall projection rises to **58–59 expected points**, clearly within the European performance band. Around 50 points should be sufficient for a top-six finish this season, leaving VfB with a healthy buffer. While the **skill ranks remain broadly stable**, offensive and home-performance components improve steadily — evidence that the underlying game model is maturing.\n\n---\n\n## Model insights (v1.1)\nThe updated figures are encouraging. Stuttgart remain **structurally stable** (defence around league rank 6), with rising attacking output and stronger control metrics. The model projects **58–59 xPs**, consistent with a **4th-place** finish.  \n\nContext versus key competitors:\n- **Leipzig lose in Hoffenheim** — VfB move back ahead.\n- **Frankfurt beat Mainz** and close in slightly.\n- **Köln lose in Gladbach**, now **7 xPs** behind Frankfurt.\n- **Hoffenheim (win vs Leipzig)** and **Bremen (win vs Wolfsburg)** stabilise but are not immediate threats.\n\nNet effect: **gap upwards reduced, cushion downwards maintained.**  \nFor reference, the non-relegation line currently sits around **33 xPs** — with roughly four further wins, VfB would be safely through on expectation. 😉\n\n---\n\n## Position probabilities (1–18) — VfB Stuttgart\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16–18 |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 0.0 % | 5.4 % | 14.1 % | 23.2 % | 24.8 % | 16.2 % | 8.6 % | 3.7 % | 2.3 % | 1.0 % | 0.6 % | 0.3 % | 0.0 % | 0.0 % | 0.0 % | 0.0 % |\n\n### Derived targets (Δ vs. previous week)\n\n| Target | Probability | Δ |\n|:--|--:|--:|\n| Champion (1st) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n| Champions League (1–4) | 43.8 % | ▲ + 8.7 pp |\n| International (1–6) | 83.7 % | ▲ + 10.0 pp |\n| incl. 7th place | 91.9 % | ▲ + 6.1 pp |\n| Relegation (16th) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |\n\n**Reading:** The probabilities for European football increase significantly. The Augsburg win and Köln’s loss are clearly reflected: +8.7 pp for Champions League range, +10 pp for top six — Europa moves back within firm reach. (A formal interval analysis against historical seasons remains on the to-do list.)\n\n---\n\n## Team skills — Borussia Dortmund vs VfB Stuttgart (as of MD11)\n\n| Team | xG Home (rk) | xG Away (rk) | Attack (rk) | Defence ↓ (rk) | HFA (rk) |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| Borussia Dortmund | 2.17 (3) | 1.81 (3) | +0.29 (3) | −0.24 (2) | +0.06 (7) |\n| VfB Stuttgart | 1.75 (8) | 1.71 (5) | +0.23 (5) | −0.04 (6) | −0.10 (9) |\n\n**Expected score (multiplicative model):** Dortmund **2.09** – VfB **1.34**  \n→ **Slight edge for BVB**, a complete top side across all compartments; Stuttgart’s route lies in control phases and well-timed transitions.\n\n**Tactical options:** Expect Hoeneß to lean on structure and compactness — an asymmetrical 4-4-2 in pressing, with situational drops into a 5-4-1 (three centre-backs option). Fast wide outlets and second-ball focus can disrupt Dortmund’s buildup. A deeper, more patient spell is not regression but part of the plan: break rhythm, protect balance, and exploit transition moments.\n\n---\n\n## Scoreline frequency matrix (Borussia Dortmund – VfB Stuttgart, 1,000 sims)\n\n| **HG \\\\ AG** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5+ |\n|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| 0 | 4.7 % | 6.6 % | 3.9 % | 1.7 % | 0.8 % | 0.2 % |\n| 1 | 7.9 % | 10.3 % | 6.6 % | 2.5 % | 1.2 % | 0.5 % |\n| 2 | 7.8 % | 9.7 % | 7.1 % | 3.3 % | 1.3 % | 0.6 % |\n| 3 | 5.3 % | 6.8 % | 4.8 % | 2.1 % | 0.8 % | 0.2 % |\n| 4 | 1.9 % | 2.7 % | 1.8 % | 0.8 % | 0.3 % | 0.1 % |\n| 5+| 0.7 % | 0.9 % | 0.6 % | 0.2 % | 0.1 % | 0.0 % |\n\n**Reading:** An open top fixture with a slight Dortmund advantage. Scorelines around **2–1** and **3–1** appear most frequent; a draw (~20 %) is realistic; a VfB win (~23 %) represents the structural upside.\n\n---\n\n## Model vs Market\n\n| Source | 🏠 Dortmund win | 🤝 Draw | 🏁 VfB win |\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|\n| Model (1,000 sims) | 56.7 % | 20.0 % | 23.3 % |\n| Market (implied) | 54.8 % | 22.5 % | 22.7 % |\n| Δ (Model − Market) | +1.9 pp | −2.5 pp | +0.6 pp |\n\n**Reading:** Market and model are closely aligned. The market prices Dortmund slightly higher and the draw slightly more likely; the model credits VfB with a bit more structural resilience away from home.\n\n---\n\n## Mid-term outlook (MD 8–11)\n\n| MD | Fixture | p_home | p_draw | p_away | xPs (MD7) | xPs (MD8) | xPs (MD9) | xPs (MD10) |\n|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n| 8 | VfB – Mainz (2:1) | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.43 | 3.00 | 3.00 | 3.00 |\n| 9 | Leipzig – VfB (3:1) | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.31 | 1.29 | 0.00 (actual) | 0.00 |\n| 10 | VfB – Augsburg (3:2) | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 1.80 | 1.85 | 1.82 | 3.00 (actual) |\n| 11 | Dortmund – VfB | 0.567 | 0.200 | 0.233 | 0.95 | 0.96 | 0.97 | 0.90 |\n|  | **Total (8–11)** |  |  |  | **5.49 xPs** | **7.10 xPs** | **5.79 xPs** | **6.90 xPs** |\n\n**Reading:** The Augsburg win puts VfB at **+1.18 xP above expectation** over this stretch. The projection climbs to **6.9 xPs** — target path confirmed; Dortmund will serve as the next calibration point.\n\n---\n\n## Projected table (Top 6)\n\n| Pos | Team | Exp Pts | Avg Pos |\n|:--|:--|--:|--:|\n| 2 | Borussia Dortmund | 66.8 | 3.0 |\n| 3 | Bayer 04 Leverkusen | 66.7 | 3.0 |\n| 4 | VfB Stuttgart | 58.6 | 4.9 |\n| 5 | RB Leipzig | 57.8 | 5.2 |\n| 6 | Eintracht Frankfurt | 55.9 | 5.7 |\n\n**Observations:** Leipzig’s loss in Hoffenheim and VfB’s win restore Stuttgart to 4th. Frankfurt’s win against Mainz closes the gap. Köln’s defeat in Gladbach keeps them seven xPs adrift. Hoffenheim and Bremen score important wins and stabilise below. **Gap up reduced, gap down preserved — structural thesis intact.**\n\n---\n\n## Model & Calibration (v1.1) — unchanged\nThe static **xG factor model** applies actuarial principles (expectation & variance) to football, combining league baselines, home advantage, and team factors on a log scale.  \nNew in v1.1: **machine-learning-assisted calibration**, adaptive team weighting, higher uncertainty for promoted sides, and continuous re-weighting as the season progresses.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nA win with lessons rather than euphoria: VfB remain structurally solid, improve offensively, and continue to show **mental resilience**. The model sees **58–59 xPs**, the team currently performs in line with that trajectory. The balance between control and consequence sharpened against Augsburg; now Dortmund away will show how far this side has come.\n\n---\n<p>Tags:\n{% for tag in page.tags %}\n  <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n</p>\n",

    "content": "\n\nWhat began as a personal ambition to **understand GenAI end to end**, not only as a user but as a quant and actuary working through every layer, has now turned into a full application with its first release. \n\nMuch like the early race to the moon, the goal was clear but ambitious:\n- reliably produce technical and structured reporting  \n- integrate data and validation into the workflow (up and downstream)  \n- select the right model for the right job (respect licencing)  \n- reduce deployment hurdles and improve privacy options  \n\n> “We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.”  \n> — President John F. Kennedy, Rice University, September 12, 1962\n\nAnd just like the engineers and astronauts who needed every minute for what mattered most, doctors should not be sweating over routine memos. Your mission is the patient, not the paperwork.\n\n### Why reliability matters  \nThe Memo Generator app was built with one core commitment: **users do not train models with their private data**. Privacy and industry standards must be guaranteed by design. Anyone building their own path into AI should consider this early, so practitioners rely on safety, redundancy and transparent logic instead of learning from avoidable failures (Disclaimer: I am not indicating that Apollo's failures were avoidable, but rather showing I learn from them).\n\n### What the app delivers today  \nThe system takes a spoken medical memo or structured data from standard APIs and turns it into a validated, structured clinical report. It combines dynamic auditing, glossary-based standardisation and multi-format output (HTML, DOCX, PDF, JSON). The interface is transparent at every step. Model choice, performance settings, languages and translations are user options. Audit logs cover operations and safety; validation reports address technical, linguistic and content-related aspects.\n\nHere is a first glimpse of the interface (German example):\n\n![Screenshot of the Memo Generator interface in German](/assets/img/memo_generator_ui.png)\n\nCurrent capabilities include  \n- spoken memo ingestion  \n- structured API inputs  \n- validation and auditing  \n- glossary logic  \n- multi-format output  \n\nBut why stop here, when the ground for future agentic services and processes across settings, tasks and domains is prepared? This my personal mission to Mars, and I am confident I can land this until Christmas.\n\n### Next steps  \nThe project continues with a clear roadmap.\n\n1. Provide a **REST API** so the full system and the atomic services integrate seamlessly into any local environment.  \n2. Introduce **self-learning capability**, train it on bootstrapped reporting data, to make the application more generic, robust and adaptive.  \n3. Generalise a **domain-independent framework** based on the operational foundations established here.  \n\n### A Swiss approach to AI engineering  \nReliability, transparency and control remain at the centre. The intention is not to build another generic service but a precise, local-first reporting engine that practitioners can trust. A rocket that takes the practitioner where they need to go, and a module that brings them back safely.\n\nIf you are interested in the lessons learned along the way, or if you are exploring structured reporting and local AI workflows in health, finance or other operational domains, feel free to reach out.\n\n--- \n\n<p>Tags: {% for tag in page.tags %} <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %} {% endfor %} </p>",

    "content": "\n\nAs a sporting director, I’m not looking for more statistics. I’m looking for clarity.  \nPredictive intelligence helps me understand where we truly stand, how our season is shifting, and what decisions are becoming unavoidable.\n\n---\n\n## Key messages\n- **Expected league position** filters out noise and reveals our real competitive level.  \n- **Probability trajectories** show whether the season is stabilising or drifting.  \n- **Squad dashboards** explain *why* results happen and where structural weaknesses lie.  \n- **Predictive modelling** improves communication, planning and decision-making across the club.\n- xGs are silver, **xPs are gold**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Expected position — a clearer league table  \nI use the expected end-of-season position as the first anchor for discussions with coaches, the board, and scouts.\n\n![Expected League Position](/assets/img/Liga_ErwartetePositionEndtabelle.png)\n\nHere, Leipzig stabilises upward while Wolfsburg drifts downward; a reminder that results and underlying performance often diverge. This informs tone, expectations and the urgency of interventions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Probability trajectories — how the season is really unfolding  \nTrend lines matter more than snapshots.\n\n![Wolfsburg Probabilities](/assets/img/VfLWolfsburg_EntwicklungWahrscheinlichkeiten.png)\n\nWolfsburg’s falling UCL probability and rising relegation risk tell a simple story: the early view and current performance of the squad is diverging, and course-correction becomes a strategic necessity.\n\nI rely on these curves to judge whether we stay on plan or need to adjust.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Deep squad view — understanding *why* results happen  \nThis VfB dashboard illustrates how structural insight replaces guesswork.\n\n![VfB Dashboard](/assets/img/vfb_dashboard_brandstyle_v3.png)\n\nKey signals I look for:\n\n- Expected score vs market assessment - my look in the mirror to truly understand external perception\n- Squad strengths and weaknesses (attack, defence, home/away profile)  - who am I, how strong is my competitor\n- Scenario probabilities (Top 6, relegation, mid-table) - am I still on track, to separate the heat of the moment from my management objectives \n- Expected-points outlook for the next fixtures - how do I navigate the immediate future\n- Final table - move away from 6-points-game now, to truly understand who am I competing with currently\n\nThese views align conversations with coaching staff and support decisions on rotation, recruitment and development. The coach can adapt and simulate strategies (squad choice and tactical formation).\n\n---\n\n## 4. What predictive intelligence enables  \nIn daily practice, it gives me:\n\n- A neutral, model-based view of squad quality  \n- Early detection of performance drift  \n- Better planning for finance, budgeting, contracts, transfers and coaching  \n- More credible communication with board, owners and supporters  \n\nPredictive intelligence doesn’t remove uncertainty — it gives it structure.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \nFootball is chaotic in the short run but structural in the long run. As a sporting director, I use predictive models to understand those structures, anticipate inflection points and make decisions before problems become visible in the table.\n\nThe truth is on the pitch — but the future becomes visible in the model.\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags: {% for tag in page.tags %} <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %} {% endfor %} </p>\n",

    "content": "\n\nQuantitative betting differs fundamentally from intuition-driven tipping.  \nIt follows a structured workflow: **identify value**, **construct portfolios**, **assess risk**.  \nThis post illustrates how a data-driven bettor approaches Matchday 12 — calm, systematic, evidence-based.\n\n---\n\n## Key messages  \nPortfolios win — not individual bets.  \nThe visualisations below highlight the core insights:\n\n- Value is the starting point, not the decision.  \n- Equal Weight is inefficient; Max Return is overly concentrated.  \n- Optimised portfolios provide the best balance of return, risk and stability.  \n- Risk profiles and loss contributions become meaningful only when visualised.\n\nKey metrics from Matchday 12:\n\n| λ   | Return | VaR(95%) | Concentration |\n|----:|--------:|----------:|---------------:|\n| 0.0 | 7.79    | 9.64      | 53%            |\n| 0.1 | 8.04    | 9.84      | 64%            |\n| 0.5 | 7.06    | 8.81      | 45%            |\n| 1.0 | 6.98    | 8.67      | 47%            |\n| 2.0 | 3.31    | 5.50      | 17%            |\n\n---\n\n## 1. Value as the entry point  \nA bet has value when the modelled probability exceeds the implied probability of the market price.  \nFor Matchday 12, seven bets meet this criterion and form the **initial opportunity set**.\n\n| MD | Home          | Away        | Outcome | Odds | p(model) | EV/unit |\n|---:|---------------|-------------|---------|------|----------|--------:|\n| 12 | Union Berlin  | Heidenheim  | 2       | 5.40 | 0.292    | 0.5768  |\n| 12 | Leverkusen    | Dortmund    | 1       | 2.55 | 0.410    | 0.0455  |\n| 12 | Hamburger SV  | Stuttgart   | 2       | 2.20 | 0.507    | 0.1154  |\n| 12 | Freiburg      | Mainz       | 2       | 4.10 | 0.346    | 0.4186  |\n| 12 | Werder Bremen | Köln        | 1       | 2.25 | 0.490    | 0.1025  |\n| 12 | Hoffenheim    | Augsburg    | X       | 4.00 | 0.256    | 0.0240  |\n| 12 | Hoffenheim    | Augsburg    | 2       | 4.35 | 0.450    | 0.9575  |\n\nA few points stand out:\n\n- **Magnitude varies significantly:** from marginal opportunities (EV ≈ 0.02) to strong mispricings such as Hoffenheim–Augsburg (2) with **EV ≈ 0.96**.  \n- **Value is not a stake signal:** it identifies *which bets merit further analysis*, not how much to allocate.  \n- The true decision happens on the **portfolio level**, after diversification and risk are considered.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Strategies and the efficient frontier  \nThe following visualisation shows how different strategies behave in the return–risk space:\n\n![Efficient Portfolio](/assets/img/EffizientesPortfolio.png)\n\n- **Equal Weight**: wide, uncontrolled dispersion.  \n- **Min Risk**: narrow, well-defined downside limits.  \n- **Max Return**: strong return potential but extremely concentrated exposure.  \n- **Optimised λ-portfolios**: balanced, risk-aware, and efficient.\n\nThe plot conveys more insight than paragraphs of text — it makes efficiency visible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How strategies actually allocate capital  \nThe allocation view illustrates the logic of each strategy:\n\n![Strategy Stakes](/assets/img/StrategienWetteinsatz.png)\n\n- Equal Weight distributes capital arbitrarily.  \n- Min Risk stabilises exposures through diversification.  \n- Max Return concentrates heavily on the highest EV bet.  \n- λ-portfolios balance return and diversification in line with risk preferences.\n\nThe benefit: **misallocations appear visually, not retrospectively.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Comparing P&L distributions  \nThe shape of each P&L distribution explains the strategy’s behaviour:\n\n![P&L Comparison](/assets/img/PnLVergleich.png)\n\n- Equal Weight: broad and unstructured.  \n- Min Risk: calm, tight, predictable.  \n- Max Return: volatile with wide swings.  \n- λ-portfolios: controlled transitions between the extremes.\n\nInterpretation is guided by the chart, not assumptions.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Which bet contributes which risk?  \nLoss contributions show where risk originates:\n\n![P&L Drilldown](/assets/img/PnLDrilldown.png)\n\n- Risk becomes attributable to individual bets.  \n- Dominant loss drivers stand out clearly.  \n- Portfolio decisions gain transparency and justification.\n\nRisk management becomes explicit instead of conceptual.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \nQuantitative betting relies on **structure**, **model-driven logic**, and **visual clarity**:\n\n- Value identifies opportunities — not stakes.  \n- Portfolios replace individual bets.  \n- Risk becomes visible *before* it materialises.  \n- Visualisations carry most of the insight; the text simply provides context.\n\nThis approach shifts decision-making from intuition to robust analytical judgement.\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags: {% for tag in page.tags %} <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %} {% endfor %} </p>\n",

    "content": "\n\n## Key Messages\n- **Outcomes differ because systems differ.** Success in ALM is not about expert teams, but about whether the organisation operates as an integrated system.\n- **Fragmentation destroys value silently.** Misaligned risk, treasury, capital, pricing, accounting and investment functions create hidden frictional costs and deteriorating capacity.\n- **ALM is a strategic engine, not a reporting function.** When designed intentionally, it coordinates constraints, economics, liquidity and solvency into one steering logic.\n- **Integrated ALM creates capacity, discipline and clarity.** It enables better pricing, more stable earnings, improved growth decisions and transparent risk–return profiles.\n- **A modern ALM system must be timely, connected and economically grounded.** This article outlines how such a system is structured and why it matters.\n\n---\n\n\nIn my career, I have seen what it takes for deals to succeed, for risks to be absorbed cleanly, for losses to be avoided, for appetite to stay aligned, for growth to build on discipline, for limits to guide decisions, for treasury and capital management to create value, for the investment function to contribute real economic return, for pricing to remain tight, for models to illuminate reality, for capital to be well allocated, for accounting to support true economics, for processes to be timely, and for frameworks to be holistic.  \n**These outcomes are not coincidences. They arise from systems that are designed, connected, and governed for complexity.**\nBut across the industry, these systems rarely exist in full. Insurers often rely on fragmented processes and misaligned functions: treasury acting without visibility into liquidity pathways, capital management operating on stale assumptions, investments pursuing return without ALM integration, pricing working with incomplete constraints, and accounting frameworks that distort rather than clarify economic value.\n\nWhen this happens, insurers experience recurring patterns:\n- appetite evaporates without clear cause  \n- frictional costs accumulate unnoticed  \n- limits become symbolic rather than binding  \n- pricing becomes too generous under pressure  \n- growth stalls despite market opportunity  \n- profitability erodes long before it appears in P&L  \n\nNone of this is due to weak teams — the expertise exists everywhere.  \n**The issue is that the system does not reflect the actual risks, frictions, constraints, and interdependencies of modern balance sheets.**\n\nThis is the heart of ALM.\n\nALM is not a reporting function. It is the **strategic engine** that integrates:\n- capital  \n- liquidity  \n- investment  \n- treasury  \n- accounting  \n- pricing  \n- market risk  \n\nWhen ALM works, it unlocks capacity, enforces discipline, strengthens pricing, reveals frictional costs, and turns complexity into navigable structure. When it fails, value is destroyed silently — in treasury flows, spread realism, liquidity constraints, reinvestment assumptions, and accounting artefacts.\nA modern ALM function must therefore be **intentional, timely, integrated, explainable, and economically grounded**.\n\nThat is the journey this article explores: **how insurers can build systems that deliver the outcomes we know are possible — and avoid the failures we have all seen.**\n\n---\n\n## The ALM System — Overview\nALM must be understood as a **connected system**, not a department.  \nThe diagram below illustrates this structure in a mobile-friendly format.\n\n![ALM System Diagram](/assets/img/ALM_System_small.png){:class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"ALM as a System\"}\n\n**Figure:** *Strategy → ALM Core Engine → Functional Engines → Translators → Outcomes, with feedback loops that refine appetite and constraints.*\n\nTo clarify the layers shown in the simplified diagram:\n- **Strategic layer:** appetite and constraints  \n- **Core engine:** integrated economic, liquidity, capital and accounting views  \n- **Functional pillars:** investments, treasury, capital management  \n- **Translators:** pricing & accounting as constraint enforcers  \n- **Outcomes:** steering, capacity, growth, stability  \n- **Feedback loop:** outcomes refine appetite dynamically  \n\n---\n\n## Why Systems Win Where Processes Fail\nMost insurers do not suffer from lack of intelligence or expertise. They suffer from **disconnected systems**:\n- Treasury decisions that ignore investment flows  \n- Capital assumptions that lag economic reality  \n- Pricing frameworks unaware of liquidity constraints  \n- Investments managed without solvency context  \n- Accounting volatility shaping decisions more than economics  \n\nThe ALM system binds these parts into a coherent whole — and coherence is what produces high-quality outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## What a Modern ALM Engine Must Deliver\nA functioning ALM system provides:\n- **Timeliness** — decisions based on updated economic, liquidity and solvency conditions  \n- **Integration** — one coordinated model of risk, capital, liquidity and accounting  \n- **Explainability** — narratives that reconcile numbers with decisions  \n- **Economic grounding** — true value creation over accounting artefacts  \n- **Strategic feedback** — outcomes that refine appetite dynamically  \n\nALM becomes **active steering**, not backward reporting.\n\n---\n\n## The Value Case for Integrated ALM\nWith a modern ALM system, insurers gain:\n- visibility of frictional costs  \n- discipline in pricing  \n- capital efficiency  \n- liquidity resilience  \n- clearer growth decisions  \n- reduced operational surprises  \n- transparency in risk and return  \n\nWithout it, value disappears silently for years through cumulative structural leakage.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nALM is not about producing reports. It is about building systems that create **clarity**, **capacity**, and **long-term value**.\nInsurers who recognise this shift — and who design ALM as an integrated, feedback-driven engine — position themselves for sustainable profitability and disciplined growth.\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags: {% for tag in page.tags %} <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %} {% endfor %} </p>\n",

    "content": "\n\n## Key Messages\n- **Enterprise intelligence is no longer exclusive.** Open-source and LLMs have collapsed the cost and capability gap once dominated by Palantir.  \n- **Licensing and economics shape strategy.** Open ecosystems provide sovereignty and adaptability; proprietary ones restrict it.  \n- **Low-code tools promise simplicity but limit depth.** Python + LLM + pipelines deliver real capability with low complexity.  \n- **Skills are broadly attainable.** Python, SQL, orchestration, lineage and LLMs now form a realistic stack for small teams.  \n- **Small businesses can now build their own operating system.** What once required enterprise budgets is now achievable on a single workstation.\n\n---\n\nFor years, Palantir set the benchmark for connected data, modelling, and operational intelligence. I’ve worked with teams that used Palantir-style platforms, and I’ve built modern Python/LLM systems in insurance, finance, sports analytics and medical documentation. From this dual experience one conclusion is clear: **what once required Palantir can now be built with open-source tools at a fraction of the cost — with far more strategic control.** This shift is driven by open licensing, drastically lower compute costs, and the capability unlocked by LLMs, while low-code platforms still fail to deliver the depth and flexibility they promise.\n\n## 1. Licenses & Costs: The Strategic Break\nThe difference between enterprise platforms and open source is primarily about **ownership and economics**, not features. Open-source components (MIT/Apache) provide:\n- **sovereignty and no lock-in**,  \n- **no proprietary friction around data or models**,  \n- **full control over logic**, crucial for ALM, risk, medical or analytics IP.\n\nCost amplifies the shift. Enterprise platforms operate at **CHF2,000–CHF8,000 per user/month**, whereas a modern Python/LLM intelligence layer typically costs **CHF30–CHF150 per user/month**. The impact is not just savings — it expands option space: more users, more experimentation, and budget shifted back to modelling instead of licensing. **Cost + LLMs have lowered the barrier dramatically.**\n\n## 2. Skills: Why the Discipline Is Now Replicable\nPalantir’s real value is the discipline of connecting data → models → decisions → operations. Today, that discipline is replicable with accessible skills:\n- **Python** for modelling and automation  \n- **SQL** for business logic  \n- **LLMs** for extraction, summarisation and agent workflows  \n- **Airflow/Prefect** for reliable pipelines  \n- **Lineage tools** for auditability  \n- **Postgres + DuckDB** as a compact analytical backbone  \n- **FastAPI** for operational services  \n- **Superset/Metabase** for dashboards  \n- **GitHub/GitLab** for CI/CD\n\nThese are standard modern data tools, not specialised vendor-only skills. **The barrier to enterprise-grade capability has collapsed.**\n\n## 3. Strategy: Building Your Own Operating System\nHaving worked with both proprietary and open architectures, the strategic distinction is sharp. Palantir offers:\n- fast integration,  \n- embedded teams,  \n- governed workflows,  \n- and a strong opinionated operating model.\n\nOpen source offers something different:\n- **differentiation** — your models reflect your worldview,  \n- **replaceability** — every layer can evolve independently,  \n- **sovereignty** — essential for regulated or sensitive environments,  \n- **compounding internal expertise**, not outsourced dependency.\n\nFor ALM, reinsurance, pensions, healthcare, or sports analytics this is decisive: **your modelling IP is your competitive edge — you cannot outsource your edge.**\n\n## 4. Entry Level: Why Even a Small Team Can Do This\nThe most dramatic change is how accessible these systems have become. LLMs and open-source tooling have removed the entry barrier entirely. A single engineer can build a functional intelligence layer using:\n- **Python + SQL**,  \n- **Postgres + DuckDB**,  \n- **Airflow or Prefect**,  \n- **Pandas/dbt**,  \n- **FastAPI**,  \n- **Superset**,  \n- **GitHub**,  \n- **local or cloud LLMs** (Mistral, LLaMA).\n\nWith this, any business can automate:\n- reporting, documentation and reconciliation,  \n- ALM, capital or pricing projections,  \n- underwriting workflows,  \n- portfolio and customer analytics,  \n- sports simulations,  \n- medical case processing.\n\nI’ve built on setups as small as a single workstation with a mid-range CPU/GPU (and can be leased or owned). **This is not big-tech territory — it is hands on data science within reach of small teams.** Also, in stanard software you pay for all layers immediately, despite in practice, you can only build one layer at a time. This usually starts with pipelines and data sourcing.\n\n## Conclusion: Own Your Operating System\nPalantir remains powerful, but the landscape has changed. If you understand data and modelling, you can now build a **sovereign, flexible, automated intelligence layer** that reflects your business rather than a vendor’s template. With cost no longer a barrier, the strategic question becomes simple: **do you want to own your operating system — or rent it?**\n\n---\n\n<p>Tags: {% for tag in page.tags %} <a href=\"/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/\">{{ tag }}</a>{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %} {% endfor %} </p>\n",
