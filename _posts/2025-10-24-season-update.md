## VfB Stuttgart – Three Points on Command, Firmly on Course for Europe

### Match summary (VfL Wolfsburg 0–3 VfB Stuttgart)
Observers and analysts described the performance as **dominant and mature**—tactically controlled, physically strong, and executed with a clear plan. Emphasis fell on **defensive organization, midfield pressing**, and **clinical finishing**; the 3:0 scoreline mirrored the balance of play and underlined Stuttgart’s growing structural stability.

## Performance & Points Balance
The win in Wolfsburg was both **convincing and above expectation**. The model estimated a **38.9% win probability** and **23.6% draw probability**, corresponding to **1.40 expected points (xP)**. With three points actually secured, VfB achieved a **+1.6 xP overperformance**, a meaningful gain that reinforces its position among the top sides. After Matchday 7, Stuttgart’s projection stands at **56 expected points** and an **average simulated league position of 5.2**, consolidating its place within the European bracket.

## Trend and Context
The development remains positive. The **probability of a Champions League qualification** has increased further, supported by **Eintracht Frankfurt’s inconsistent form**. The model portrays VfB as **defensively compact, offensively efficient**, and stable in shot creation and conversion. Markets tend to overweight **recent momentum**, while the model prioritises **structural consistency**; as the season progresses, this divergence becomes visible—prices move faster with form, the model adjusts more gradually via its new **learning calibration**.

## Position Probabilities (1–18)

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16–18 |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 0.0 | 9.9 | 11.8 | 20.3 | 21.2 | 13.4 | 9.0 | 6.3 | 3.3 | 1.9 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.0 |

### Derived Targets and Weekly Changes

| Target | Probability | Δ vs. last week |
|:--|--:|--:|
| Champion (1st) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |
| Champions League (1–4) | 42.0 % | ▲ + 8.4 pp |
| International (1–6) | 76.6 % | ▲ + 7.2 pp |
| incl. 7th place | 85.6 % | ▲ + 4.4 pp |
| Relegation (16th) | 0.0 % | ▼ − 0.1 pp |
| Direct relegation (17–18) | 0.0 % | ± 0.0 pp |

These shifts highlight the **emerging separation within the league**: a clear top six with VfB well established, followed by Köln and Mainz already several expected points behind.

## Matchday 8 Preview: VfB Stuttgart – 1. FSV Mainz 05

### Team Skills (current values, league ranks in parentheses)

| Team | xG Home | xG Away | Attack | Defence (↓ better) | Home HFA |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| VfB Stuttgart | 1.73 (7) | 1.61 (5) | 0.15 (5) | −0.06 (7) | −0.02 (8) |
| 1. FSV Mainz 05 | 1.46 (11) | 1.49 (7) | 0.07 (7) | **−0.15 (3)** | −0.11 (11) |

**Expected Score (model):** VfB 1.49 – Mainz 1.40 — two compact sides with a narrow analytical edge for Stuttgart.

### Scoreline Frequency Matrix (1 000 simulations)

| **HG \\ AG** | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5 +** |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **0** | 5.9 % | 8.6 % | 6.2 % | 2.7 % | 1.1 % | 0.5 % |
| **1** | 7.9 % | **12.4 %** | 6.0 % | 4.1 % | 1.8 % | 0.1 % |
| **2** | 6.6 % | 9.6 % | 5.2 % | 2.4 % | 1.3 % | 0.1 % |
| **3** | 3.5 % | 3.5 % | 2.5 % | 1.5 % | 0.5 % | — |
| **4** | 0.9 % | 0.9 % | 0.9 % | 1.2 % | 0.3 % | 0.1 % |
| **5 +** | 0.4 % |	0.2 % | 0.5 % |	0.1 % |	— |	— |


**Interpretation:** Results cluster around 1:1, 1:0 and 2:1—typical one-goal matches with a slight VfB bias. High-scoring outcomes remain rare (<1%), underscoring the **defensive consistency** of both teams.

### Model vs. Market

| Source | VfB Win | Draw | Mainz Win |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Model (1 000 sims) | 39.2 % | 25.3 % | 35.5 % |
| Oddset (implied) | 57.1 % | 25.0 % | 23.8 % |
| Δ (Model – Market) | −17.9 pp | +0.3 pp | +11.7 pp |

**Interpretation:** Markets reward recent momentum and assign a notably higher win chance to Stuttgart. The model stays cautious, still crediting Mainz with one of the league’s most resilient defences. Such divergence is typical mid-season: **market prices reflect form**, whereas the model weights **systemic team balance**.

## Mid-Term Outlook (Matchdays 8–11)

| MD | Fixture | p_home | p_draw | p_away | xPs |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 8 | VfB – Mainz | 0.392 | 0.253 | 0.355 | **1.43** |
| 9 | Leipzig – VfB | 0.407 | 0.234 | 0.359 | **1.31** |
| 10 | VfB – Augsburg | 0.523 | 0.232 | 0.245 | **1.80** |
| 11 | Dortmund – VfB | 0.550 | 0.198 | 0.252 | **0.95** |
| **Total (8–11)** |  |  |  |  | **≈ 5.5 xPs** |

The next fixtures are more demanding—particularly the **two away matches**—lowering the expected average to **~1.37 xP per game**. This sits just below typical Europa League pace yet remains consistent with the **56-point season projection**.

## Projected Table (Top 6 Extract)

| Pos | Team | Exp Pts | Avg Pos |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|
| 2 | Borussia Dortmund | 63.9 | 3.1 |
| 3 | Bayer 04 Leverkusen | 62.9 | 3.3 |
| 4 | VfB Stuttgart | **56.2** | **5.2** |
| 5 | Eintracht Frankfurt | 55.7 | 5.2 |
| 6 | RB Leipzig | 54.1 | 6.0 |

The Wolfsburg victory lifted VfB’s expected total and, together with Frankfurt’s draw in Freiburg, pushed Stuttgart back into the **projected top four**.

## Model and Calibration (v1.1)
The *static xG factor model* applies **actuarial principles** (expectation and variance) to football analysis and combines **league baselines, home advantage, and team factors** on a log scale.

**New in v1.1:** Calibration enhanced by **machine learning** and **adaptive team weighting**; promoted clubs (HSV, Köln) are modelled with **higher uncertainty** to reflect limited Bundesliga data—without blending with last season’s relegated teams (Kiel, Bochum). Weighting is **re-evaluated** as the season progresses and evidence accumulates.

## Conclusion
A decisive performance and a +1.6 xP surplus over expectation confirm Stuttgart’s **balance and efficiency**. While the market leans toward form and the model toward structure, both perspectives point in the same direction: VfB Stuttgart is **firmly positioned as a European-level contender**, with the **Champions League zone** within reach.
