Gary Lineker: 'Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.'

This quote says a lot, it is a simple game, meaning one goal one score, and 
both teams have a continuous chance to score during a fixed time of 90 minutes.
The game has a relatively low scoring intensity, ranging about 1.5 goals per team
and match. Of course, 
a) Germany just recently lost against Slovakia, and 
b) it were pointless to write this, if Germany always wins.
