ðŸš€ Building and Deploying with Jekyll on GitHub Pages

Today, I set up a personal site entirely on GitHub Pages â€” no local Ruby setup required. Along the way, I deepened my understanding of:

- Static site generation with Jekyll and its templating logic (front matter, loops, and config files)
- Automation using GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
- Theme customization and clean information architecture (Home Â· Projects Â· CV Â· Contact)
- Content structuring through collections and metadata for project portfolios

Itâ€™s been a great hands-on way to combine software engineering practice with personal branding.
Next step: refining layout, adding visuals, and publishing more project showcases.

If youâ€™ve built a developer or portfolio site recently â€” what setup worked best for you?
