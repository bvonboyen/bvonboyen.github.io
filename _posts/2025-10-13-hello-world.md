ðŸš€ My first Jekyll steps on GitHub Pages

Since yesterday Iâ€™ve built and deployed my own Jekyll site â€” fully hosted on GitHub Pages, no local Ruby setup needed.

I:

created the repo bvonboyen.github.io and configured Basically Basic as the remote theme, added GitHub Actions for automated builds,
set up a clean homepage and navigation (Home Â· Projects Â· CV Â· Contact),
added my first project collection (_projects/) with a detailed SoccerSim card,
and learned how Jekyll loops, front matter, and _config.yml drive content.

Next up: refining layout, adding visuals, and publishing the remaining project cards.

Would you like me to make this version more blog-ready (with a front matter header so it renders as a post on your site)?
