What is artificial intelligence? What is the hype? How is it used?


According to **ISO/IEC 22989:2022**,  

> *Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the capability of a system to acquire, process, and apply knowledge and skills to achieve specific goals in a given environment.*

AI aims to replicate — or augment — human cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, and perception. Over time it has evolved from **rule-based reasoning** to **data-driven** and **generative systems**.

## A Structure of Intelligence

**Symbolic AI**, or *classical AI*, expresses logic through explicit rules — expert systems such as *MYCIN* or *Deep Blue* are early examples.  
**Robotics** builds on these principles, combining sensing, motion, and planning — often enhanced by learning.  
**Machine Learning** replaced rules with data patterns, from *supervised* and *probabilistic models* to *deep learning* — the basis for today’s **Generative AI**, capable of producing new, context-aware output.  
**Hybrid or neuro-symbolic AI** blends logic and learning for *explainable* and *safety-critical* applications.

The current hype around AI is from generative AI being accessible and, at the surface, understandable to the mainstream. To give some credit, it also opens new use cases within applications, such as the LLM based Health Memo Generator.

Modern autopilot systems in aviation are among the most advanced real-world examples of hybrid AI, combining rule-based logic for certified safety with learning components for adaptive control—demonstrating how intelligence can evolve within trusted boundaries. This is generally accepted by every passenger entering the airplane; even by my son, with whom I watched plain spotter videos in storm Benjamin today.

## The Actuary’s View — AI and Quantitative Reasoning

In **finance and insurance**, AI is hardly new. Tools like **AAAccell’s HedgePilot™** — a *risk and hedge monitoring and advisory platform for FX exposure* — or my **Soccersim application**, combining *probabilistic modeling* with *supervised learning* AI supports professionals in applied analytics.

Less controversial systems rest on the **pillars of quantitative reasoning**: **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **interpretability** — ensuring that **human judgment stays central**. But some methods spark fundamental controversy. Why?

## Responsible Use and Human Oversight

The real issue is not whether AI should be used, but **how it is deployed**. Implemented safeguards are essential; a simple baseline is **human-in-the-loop** — final decisions always rest with people, assisted by AI engines.

AI can also help **validate and explain AI** — generating human-readable validation reports, surfacing likely errors, performing plausibility checks, or distilling complex models into key factors. Such *meta-use* builds **trust and accountability** in professional environments, as well with regulators.

## From Reasoning to Creation

AI’s path from **rules to generation** mirrors analytical progress itself — *define, measure, create.* Its true potential lies in experts deploying this **general-purpose technology** to *domain-specific problems*, as **Prof. Charles-Albert LeHalle** remarked at *FX Trade Tech*. It continues a decades-long trend under one enduring word: **digitalization**.
