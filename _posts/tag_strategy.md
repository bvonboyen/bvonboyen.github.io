# Tag & Topic Strategy

This document defines how **tags** and **topics** are used on the homepage.

The structure is intentionally conservative:
existing topics are preserved, and tags are used to associate posts with those topics in a consistent and repeatable way.

---

## Core Principle

**Posts are tagged. Topics are derived from tags.**

A post does not explicitly select a topic.
Instead, it becomes part of one or more topics through its assigned tags.

## Topics and Their Meaning

### Risk Capacity & Exposure

**Purpose**
Posts about how much risk can be taken, how it is shaped, and how portfolios survive stress.

**Tags**

* risk
* insurance
* reinsurance
* alm
* capital-management
* exposure-management
* portfolio-thinking

**Typical content**

* exposure and aggregation
* capital allocation and limits
* ALM-style reasoning
* portfolio construction

---

### Systems & Engineering

**Purpose**
Posts about building reproducible, trustworthy systems and pipelines.

**Tags**

* systems
* architecture
* engineering
* structured-reporting
* open-source
* swiss-engineering

**Typical content**

* system architecture
* reproducible pipelines
* reporting engines
* engineering trade-offs

---

### AI & Agents

**Purpose**
Posts about operational AI systems, agents, and applied execution.

**Tags**

* ai
* agents
* agentic-pipelines
* applied-ai-systems
* local-first-ai
* precision-ai

**Typical content**

* agent and worker design
* LLM-based systems
* private and local-first AI
* AI as infrastructure

---

### Governance & Strategy

**Purpose**
Posts about how decisions, constraints, and organizations shape outcomes.

**Tags**

* governance
* strategy
* leadership
* transformation

**Typical content**

* decision frameworks
* organizational constraints
* transformation journeys
* accountability and incentives

---

### Analytics & Thinking

**Purpose**
Posts focused on analytical reasoning, mental models, and conceptual tools.

**Tags**

* analytics
* conceptual
* productivity

**Typical content**

* analytical frameworks
* conceptual lenses
* reasoning tools
* productivity through better thinking

---

### Labs & Case Material

**Purpose**
Posts grounded in concrete projects, data, or applied case material.

**Tags**

* sports
* vfb-stuttgart
* palantir
* clinical-documentation
* alpine-tech

**Typical content**

* SoccerSim outputs
* Memo Generator cases
* real dashboards or experiments
* applied project material

---

## Tag Allocation Rules

1. **Choose tags that describe what is actually in the post**
   Tags are descriptive, not aspirational.

2. **Use 2–5 tags per post**
   Fewer risks ambiguity; more dilutes signal.

3. **Cross-topic posts are expected**
   A post may naturally belong to multiple topics.

4. **Labs tags imply concreteness**
   Tags such as `sports` or `clinical-documentation` signal real data or project output.

5. **Project tags are optional**
   Use project-specific tags only when project-level browsing is meaningful.

## Examples

**Exposure management using SoccerSim**
Tags: exposure-management, portfolio-thinking, sports, analytics
Topics: Risk Capacity & Exposure; Labs & Case Material

**Agent-based reporting pipeline**
Tags: ai, agents, structured-reporting, local-first-ai
Topics: AI & Agents; Systems & Engineering

**Conceptual post on decision constraints**
Tags: governance, strategy, conceptual
Topics: Governance & Strategy; Analytics & Thinking

---

## Final Note

This strategy is designed to:

* preserve existing structure,
* support consistent tagging,
* and keep navigation intuitive.

Refinement can happen later if scale demands it — **clarity and momentum take priority**.
