### **Model Selection and the Large vs Small Trade-off**

Over the last months, I’ve moved from experimenting with chatbots to **engineering full generative-AI systems** — tools that don’t just *talk* but *work*: they extract, validate, generate, and report.  
These posts are a reflection of what I’ve learned along the way — about models, prompts, APIs, and design choices that make LLMs practical in production.

This first part looks at **model selection** — not in abstract benchmarks, but in the realities of *development* and *deployment*.

### **The Two Worlds: Large vs Small Models**

I use **large models** for **development** — when I need reasoning, creativity, or cross-domain insight.  
They are my partners in **architecture, design, coding, debugging, testing, and research**.  
They reason broadly, explain alternatives, and are forgiving when I haven’t defined a task precisely.

By contrast, I use **small models** for **deployment** — where privacy, latency, and reproducibility matter.  
Once a workflow is clear and structured, a smaller instruction-tuned model executes it faster, cheaper, and often more reliably.

### **Why Larger Isn’t Always Better**

A large model statistically produces *fewer errors a priori* — its predictions are more consistent across unseen cases.  
But that same confidence can be deceptive: when it *does* err, it often does so with *high certainty* — making the error less visible and harder to correct.  
Smaller models may make more frequent mistakes, but their uncertainty can actually help expose flaws earlier, allowing *a posteriori* corrections and stronger validation loops.

In other words:  
> **Large models are confident teachers. Small models are humble apprentices.**  
> The trick is to know when to learn from one — and when to rely on the other.

### **Outlook**

In the next posts, I’ll cover:
1. **System Prompts and Role Separation** — how I structure `system_msg`, `user_msg`, and `style` layers for predictable output.  
2. **Prompt APIs and Templates** — how Jinja templates and JSON schemas define logic before generation.  
3. **Client/Server and Deployment Models** — running local vs remote inference, caching, and parametrisation.  

Together, these reflections form a blueprint for moving from *prompting* to *building*.
