## Key Messages
- **Enterprise intelligence is no longer exclusive.** Open-source and LLMs have collapsed the cost and capability gap once dominated by Palantir.  
- **Licensing and economics shape strategy.** Open ecosystems provide sovereignty and adaptability; proprietary ones restrict it.  
- **Low-code tools promise simplicity but limit depth.** Python + LLM + pipelines deliver real capability with low complexity.  
- **Skills are broadly attainable.** Python, SQL, orchestration, lineage and LLMs now form a realistic stack for small teams.  
- **Small businesses can now build their own operating system.** What once required enterprise budgets is now achievable on a single workstation.

For years, Palantir set the benchmark for connected data, modelling, and operational intelligence. I’ve worked with teams that used Palantir-style platforms, and I’ve built modern Python/LLM systems in insurance, finance, sports analytics and medical documentation. From this dual experience one conclusion is clear: **what once required Palantir can now be built with open-source tools at a fraction of the cost — with far more strategic control.** This shift is driven by open licensing, drastically lower compute costs, and the capability unlocked by LLMs, while low-code platforms still fail to deliver the depth and flexibility they promise.

## 1. Licenses & Costs: The Strategic Break
The difference between enterprise platforms and open source is primarily about **ownership and economics**, not features. Open-source components (MIT/Apache) provide:
- **sovereignty and no lock-in**,  
- **no proprietary friction around data or models**,  
- **full control over logic**, crucial for ALM, risk, medical or analytics IP.

Cost amplifies the shift. Enterprise platforms operate at **€2,000–€8,000 per user/month**, whereas a modern Python/LLM intelligence layer typically costs **€30–€150 per user/month**. The impact is not just savings — it expands option space: more users, more experimentation, and budget shifted back to modelling instead of licensing. **Cost + LLMs have lowered the barrier dramatically.**

## 2. Skills: Why the Discipline Is Now Replicable
Palantir’s real value is the discipline of connecting data → models → decisions → operations. Today, that discipline is replicable with accessible skills:
- **Python** for modelling and automation  
- **SQL** for business logic  
- **LLMs** for extraction, summarisation and agent workflows  
- **Airflow/Prefect** for reliable pipelines  
- **Lineage tools** for auditability  
- **Postgres + DuckDB** as a compact analytical backbone  
- **FastAPI** for operational services  
- **Superset/Metabase** for dashboards  
- **GitHub/GitLab** for CI/CD

These are standard modern data tools, not specialised vendor-only skills. **The barrier to enterprise-grade capability has collapsed.**

## 3. Strategy: Building Your Own Operating System
Having worked with both proprietary and open architectures, the strategic distinction is sharp. Palantir offers:
- fast integration,  
- embedded teams,  
- governed workflows,  
- and a strong opinionated operating model.

Open source offers something different:
- **differentiation** — your models reflect your worldview,  
- **replaceability** — every layer can evolve independently,  
- **sovereignty** — essential for regulated or sensitive environments,  
- **compounding internal expertise**, not outsourced dependency.

For ALM, reinsurance, pensions, healthcare, or sports analytics this is decisive: **your modelling IP is your competitive edge — you cannot outsource your edge.**

## 4. Entry Level: Why Even a Small Team Can Do This
The most dramatic change is how accessible these systems have become. LLMs and open-source tooling have removed the entry barrier entirely. A single engineer can build a functional intelligence layer using:
- **Python + SQL**,  
- **Postgres + DuckDB**,  
- **Airflow or Prefect**,  
- **Pandas/dbt**,  
- **FastAPI**,  
- **Superset**,  
- **GitHub**,  
- **local or cloud LLMs** (Mistral, LLaMA).

With this, any business can automate:
- reporting, documentation and reconciliation,  
- ALM, capital or pricing projections,  
- underwriting workflows,  
- portfolio and customer analytics,  
- sports simulations,  
- medical case processing.

I’ve built all of these on setups as small as a single workstation with a mid-range GPU. **This is not big-tech territory — it is pragmatic engineering within reach of small teams.**

## Conclusion: Own Your Operating System
Palantir remains powerful, but the landscape has changed. If you understand data and modelling, you can now build a **sovereign, flexible, automated intelligence layer** that reflects your business rather than a vendor’s template. With cost no longer a barrier, the strategic question becomes simple: **do you want to own your operating system — or rent it?**
