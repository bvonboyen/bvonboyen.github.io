Throughout my career, I have been continuously volunteering in work and private life.

Currently, I am producing the sound, virtual services, and podcasts in a team of dedicated members at IPC.

I invite you to visit the extensive library of IPC Zurich's [Sermons](https://ipc-zurich.org/sermons/).

If you start listening regularly, you are invited to follow our podcast through Itunes or Pocketcast, or visit one of our in person service.
