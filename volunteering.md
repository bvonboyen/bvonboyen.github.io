Volunteering has always been part of my life. I am drawn to roles where **purpose, collaboration, and innovation** come together — whether in pension governance, community work, or helping organisations communicate with clarity.

## Purpose • Collaboration • Innovation

<div class="volunteering-grid-2x2">

  <div class="card volunteer-card purpose-card">
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Contributing to systems and communities that aim to serve people fairly and sustainably —
      from pension fund stewardship to faith-based community work.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <div class="card volunteer-card">
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      Working across disciplines — actuaries, trustees, musicians, volunteers — to create shared
      value and shared understanding.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card volunteer-card">
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>
      Bringing analytical thinking, system design, and clear communication into areas where they
      improve lives, strengthen trust, and support long-term stewardship.
    </p>
  </div>

## Purpose statement

> “Good systems only work when they are fair — and fairness must be intentional.”

## Prior volunteering – Pension fund stewardship

<div class="card volunteer-card">
  <p>
    I previously volunteered in the governance of a pension fund, where our mission was to
    **place equality at the heart of performance improvement**.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work focused on:
    <br>• reducing intergenerational refinancing  
    <br>• sustainable steering mechanisms  
    <br>• fair and transparent allocation  
    <br>• long-term responsibility to all generations  
    <br>• strengthening member communication  
  </p>

  <p>
    It reinforced a conviction I carry into all my analytical work:
    <strong>fairness, sustainability, and transparency are design choices — not accidents.</strong>

## Current volunteering – IPC Zurich

<div class="card volunteer-card">
  <p>
    Today, I volunteer at <strong>IPC – International Protestant Church of Zurich</strong> as part of the
    production team, helping create:
  </p>

  <p>
    • high-quality sound for in-person services<br>
    • virtual services for the wider community<br>
    • podcasts and recordings accessible to people wherever they are  
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a hands-on, collaborative role that blends technical precision with community service —
    and reflects my belief that clarity and accessibility matter in every context.
  </p>
