Throughout my career, I have continuously volunteered in both professional and personal settings.

Currently, I help produce sound, virtual services, and podcasts as part of a dedicated team at IPC - International Protestant Church of Zurich.

I invite you to explore IPC Zurich’s extensive library of [sermons](https://ipc-zurich.org/sermons/).

If you start listening regularly, feel free to follow our podcast on iTunes or Pocket Casts — or better yet, join us for one of our in-person services.
