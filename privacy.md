## Who I Am
This is a personal website created and maintained by Bernhard von Boyen, based in Zürich, Switzerland.

## Data Collection
I do not collect any personal data, and I use Google analytics for high level analysis but no tracking mechanisms. Your visit to this site is completely anonymous. Cloudflare acts as a secure intermediary, routing requests from our frontend to external services like OpenAI, ensuring all communications are encrypted and protected from malicious activity - no tracking is being done on related services on my behalf.

## Cookies & Tracking
Beyond Google Analytics, no cookies or other forms of tracking are used on this website. You are not being monitored, and no data is stored about your visit.

## Contact
If you have any questions or need further information, you can reach me at: [About](/about/)

## Statement
This is a personal website. No commercial services are offered.
