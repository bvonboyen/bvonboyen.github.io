My name is Bernhard von Boyen, a Swiss and German national, married,
and a proud father of two boys, aged 10 and 8.

I was born and raised in Ochsenhausen, Southern Germany, where I
graduated from high school in 1998 with majors in Mathematics and Physics,
and minors in English and History.

After completing my social service, I went on to study Economics and Economathematics in Ulm.
With a scholarship, chancellor's awards, and a teaching assistantship in hand,
I continued my studies at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee,
where I earned an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in 2005.

Upon returning from the U.S., I completed my degree at Ulm University and moved to Zurich,
where I began my professional career. You can find more details in my CV.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing, running, spending quality time with
my family, baking and cooking, coding in Python, traveling, and many other things. 
Before you ask: my (basic) soccer career ended at the age of 21.
