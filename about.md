My name is Bernhard von Boyen. I’m a Swiss and German national, married,
and a proud father of two boys.

I was born and raised in Ochsenhausen in Southern Germany and later studied Economics,
Economathematics, and Applied Mathematics in Ulm and at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.
Since then, Zurich has become our family’s home and the base for my work in analytics,
actuarial modelling, and decision systems. If you’d like the formal version,
you’ll find it in my CV.

## A recent chapter – our 2025 family sabbatical

In 2025, my wife and I took a three-month family sabbatical — a decision we had planned
well in advance and one that meant a lot to us. We wanted to celebrate two milestones:

- 20 years together as partners  
- 10 years as parents  

The journey took us across **three countries on three continents** — Thailand, Turkey, and the US —
by plane, train, boat, RV, bus, car, taxi/limousine, bike and rickshaw. Along the way we experienced **three
religious traditions** and very different cultural lenses: the spirituality and everyday
culture of Thailand, the layers of history in Turkey, and the vast nature of the US.

It was also a trip of relationships: celebrating my father’s 90th birthday, visiting
both sides of our family, reconnecting with old friends and colleagues, marking our
20-year graduation anniversary in Milwaukee, and spending a week in Çeşme with our
best man and his family.

For us, this sabbatical was less about “seeing the world” and more about **celebrating
commitment, presence, and intentional choices** — the same themes that shape how I think
about work, systems, and long-term responsibility.

## Beyond work

Outside of projects and modelling, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing, running, spending time
with my family, baking and cooking, coding in Python, and travelling — ideally in ways
that create stories we’ll still talk about years later. Before you ask: my (basic) soccer
career ended at the age of 21.
