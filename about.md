Hi, my name is Bernhard von Boyen, a Swiss & German national, married, 
and a proud father of two boys, 10 and 8.

I was born and raised in Ochsenhausen, Southern Germany, and this is where I 
graduated from high school in 1998 in the two majors mathematics and physics, 
and two minors English language and history.

After my social service, I moved on to study Economics and Economathematics in Ulm.
From there, with a scholarship, chancelor awards, and teaching assistantship in my pocket,
I moved to Uinversity of Wisonsin in Milwaukee. This is where I graduated with 
a M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in 2005. Returning from the US, I graduated 
from Ulm University and moved to Zurich, where I have started my professional career.
More information you can find in my CV.

In my sparetime, I like to play tennis, go skiing, run, spend quality time with 
my family, bake and cook, do Python coding, travel, and many many more things.
