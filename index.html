<p><strong>Innovation in risk &amp; value management — with people and intelligent tooling</strong></p>

<p>
  I work at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management — combining actuarial rigor with modern tools and data-driven thinking.
  My expertise spans pricing, valuation, risk control, capital, ALM, and value management, always with a focus on collaboration and emerging technologies such as generative AI.

  This site brings these domains together — from insurance and pensions to real-world modeling.
  My sports simulation project is one showcase, alongside others in my CV, project pages, and posts.
