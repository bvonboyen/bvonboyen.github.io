<p><strong>Innovation in risk &amp; value management — with people and intelligent tooling</strong></p>

<p>
  I work at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management — combining actuarial rigor with modern technology and data-driven thinking.
  The emphasis is not on individual tools or models, but on integrating analytics, performance, risk, and technology around purpose, collaboration, and innovation — strengthening system coherence for practical impact and allowing decisions to compound into durable value rather than fragment over time.

 This site brings those themes together: insurance and pensions, decision frameworks, data science, and applied coding & AI. Projects like my sports simulation lab serve as controlled environments to explore real-world risk and portfolio behavior, alongside professional work documented across projects, posts, and my CV.
