**SoccerSim** is a modular football analytics engine combining automated, but supervised learning calibrations with a factor model, linking team skills to league results.

---

## Current Application — Static Factor Model (v1.0)

The current release models match outcomes and full league seasons through **Poisson-based expected goals (xG)** and **static team-strength factors**.

**Core methods**
- Poisson and Skellam distributions for goal and score-difference modeling  
- Maximum-likelihood calibration of team attack/defense parameters
- Self learning with priors, variance control, and random noise  
- Match & season-level Monte Carlo simulations for probability tables  
- YAML-driven configuration and a clean CLI for reproducible workflows

**Use case**
- Setting up leagues, updating fixtures and tables for regular forecasts
- Calibrating factor model and deriving team skills rankings
- Creating game day and season forecasts from tables, fixtures and calibratons
- Derive analytics and betting quotes on simulations
- Portfolio simulations (equal-stake and risk-adjusted) for betting or performance studies  
- Integration with actuarial or ALM-style risk frameworks

## Future Evolution — Hierarchical, Player & Dependency Layers

The upcoming architecture expands SoccerSim from a static team-factor model toward a **hierarchical Bayesian / mixed-effects framework**, aligning with reinsurance-style risk aggregation principles:

**Planned extensions**
- **Expand factor modeling**  
  - Include shock factors for tight schedules and team management changes
  - Updating into a state space model to discover trends on unobservable factors
- **Hierarchical team-player factors**  
  - Player-level attack/participation contributions to team effects (player analytics, and trades)  
  - More responsive team strength as a dynamic mixture of player availability and form  
- **Dependency modeling across matches**  
  - Shared shocks for weather, derbies, and in-play dynamics
  - Correlated outcomes for improved realism and backtesting
- **Risk-adjusted analytics**  
  - Contributive RAR (cRAR) per bet and total portfolio volatility metrics  
  - Cross-factor calibration using ridge regularization and information-criteria control  
- **Agentic simulation layer**  
  - Scenario engines and explainable reporting for domain experts

These developments aim to merge **actuarial multi-level calibration** with **data-driven sports inference**, moving from descriptive to structural modeling.
