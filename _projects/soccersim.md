**SoccerSim** is a modular Python package for realistic football (soccer) season simulations.  
It connects actuarial calibration discipline with the excitement of sports modeling.

## ‚öΩ Current Application ‚Äî Static Factor Model (v0.3)

The current release models match outcomes and full league seasons through **Poisson-based expected goals (xG)** and **static team-strength factors**.

**Core methods**
- Poisson and Skellam distributions for goal and score-difference modeling  
- Maximum-likelihood calibration of team attack/defense parameters  
- Season-level Monte Carlo simulations for probability tables  
- YAML-driven configuration and a clean CLI for reproducible workflows  
- Audit trail and caching for deterministic validation

**Use case**
- Setting up leagues, updating fixtures and tables for regular forecasts
- Calibrating factor model and deriving team skills rankings
- Creating game day and season forecasts from fixtures and calibratons
- Derive analytics and betting quotes on simulations, to derive value bets
- Portfolio simulations (equal-stake and risk-adjusted) for betting or performance studies  
- Integration with actuarial or ALM-style risk frameworks

## üß† Future Evolution ‚Äî Hierarchical, Player & Dependency Layers

The upcoming architecture expands SoccerSim from a static team-factor model toward a **hierarchical Bayesian / mixed-effects framework**, aligning with reinsurance-style risk aggregation principles:

**Planned extensions**
- üß© **Expand factor modeling**  
  - Include shock factors for realistic derby, weather, and team management changes
  - Potentially consider a state space model to allow for stochastic trends in the data
- üß© **Hierarchical team-player factors**  
  - Player-level attack/participation coefficients with shrinkage priors  
  - Team strength as a dynamic mixture of player availability and form  
- üîó **Dependency modeling across matches**  
  - Shared shocks for weather, derbies, or scheduling congestion  
  - Correlated outcomes for realistic portfolio risk  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Risk-adjusted analytics**  
  - Contributive RAR (cRAR) per bet and total portfolio volatility metrics  
  - Cross-factor calibration using ridge regularization and information-criteria control  
- üåê **Agentic simulation layer**  
  - Scenario engines and explainable reporting for domain experts

These developments aim to merge **actuarial multi-level calibration** with **data-driven sports inference**, moving from descriptive to structural modeling.
