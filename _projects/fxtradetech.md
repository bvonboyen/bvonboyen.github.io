FX TradeTech is an international fair in Barcelona for the full ecosystem around
FX trading: banks (in their various roles), exchanges, data & intelligence providers, 
technology & system providers, corporate treasurers, brokers, consultants and various 
minor players.

On this fair, Boris and I represented AAACCELLs HedgePilot and our aim was to acquire contacts,
and to develop leads across European contacts.

The days ahead of the fair, we prepared postioning, targeted acquisition strategies, 
and presentation tactics. 

From our three days networking, AAACCELL gained clients leads, contacts for 
potential strategic platforms, and secondary contacts for future benefit 
(capital acquisition, cross service, market and product partners.) Softer factors 
included understanding in their market positioning, LinkedIn stories,
refined persona hooks, and material / ideas for future marketing.

Overall, everyone talks about (generative) AI, but generally, there are very little
concrete innovations present. Overall, there were little algorithmic vendors present and 
no other with concrete value proposition deploying artificial intelligence.

Foreign exchange trading is an uneven playing field: the buy side still focused on
internal flow and balance sheet margin, and (mostly) willing to give pricing and 
carry margins for their protection. The sell side optimizing speed, access and 
information gain, down to differentiating razor thin liquidity margins. The exchanges
sit in between, trying to pool liquidity and sell side quotes.
