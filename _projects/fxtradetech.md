### FX TradeTech Barcelona

FX TradeTech is an international fair in Barcelona that brings together the full ecosystem of FX trading — banks (in their various roles), exchanges, data and intelligence providers, technology vendors, corporate treasurers, brokers, consultants, and other market participants.

At the event, Boris and I represented AAACCELL’s HedgePilot, with the goal of acquiring new contacts and developing leads across the European FX landscape.

In the days leading up to the fair, we prepared our positioning, target-acquisition strategy, and presentation approach.
Over three days of intensive networking, AAACCELL gained client leads, potential strategic platform partners, and secondary contacts of future value — including opportunities in capital acquisition, cross-service collaborations, and market/product partnerships.

Softer outcomes included a clearer understanding of market positioning, refined LinkedIn storytelling angles, improved persona hooks, and new material and ideas for future marketing.

Interestingly, while everyone talked about (generative) AI, there were few concrete innovations on display — and almost no algorithmic vendors with tangible AI-driven value propositions.

#### The FX trading landscape remains uneven:

- The buy side still focuses on internal flow and balance-sheet margin, often willing to trade pricing and carry margins for protection.
- The sell side continues to optimize for speed, access, and information gain — differentiating across razor-thin liquidity margins.
- The exchanges sit in between, pooling liquidity and monetizing sell-side quotes.
