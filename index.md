ðŸ‘‹ Welcome â€” youâ€™ve landed in a space where **actuarial insight**, **assetâ€“liability thinking**, and **data-driven experimentation** meet the real world.

I explore how **pension and ALM professionals** can apply modern analytics and automation, how **actuaries** can evolve into data-fluency, and how **sports modelling and AI** reveal patterns that inspire better financial decisions â€” and vice versa.

Feel free to browse my projects, papers, and experiments â€” or just reach out to connect.
