💡 Connecting Transformation, Risk, and Intelligent Systems

My core work sits at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management — combining the rigor of actuarial and ALM modeling with the adaptability of AI and real-world sports simulation.

This site brings these domains together: applying principles of balance, feedback, and resilience across finance, pensions, and performance systems.

If you’re shaping transformation initiatives, exploring modern pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice — you’ll find shared ideas and practical insights here.
