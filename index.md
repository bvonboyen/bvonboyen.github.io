My core work sits at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management â€” combining the rigor of actuarial and ALM modeling with the adaptability of AI and real-world sports simulation.

This site brings these domains together: applying principles of balance, feedback, and resilience across finance, pensions, and performance systems.

If youâ€™re shaping transformation initiatives, exploring modern pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice â€” youâ€™ll find shared ideas, practical insights, my project portfolio and CV here.
