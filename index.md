ðŸ’¡ Organisational transformation, risk & value management â€” with people and intelligent tooling

I work at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management â€” combining actuarial rigor with modern tools and data-driven thinking.
My expertise spans pricing, valuation, risk control, capital, ALM, and value management, always with a focus on collaboration and emerging technologies such as generative AI.

This site brings these domains together â€” from insurance and pensions to real-world modeling.
My sports simulation project is one showcase, alongside others in my CV, project pages, and posts.

If youâ€™re driving transformation, rethinking pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice, youâ€™ll find here a mix of [shared ideas](/#posts), [quantitative insights](/tags/analytics/), and hands-on examples from [real projects](/projects/), as well as my [professional background](/cv/).

To get in touch or get to know me better, visit the [About me](/about/) page.

Sometimes beauty lies in what remains uncertain â€” Abyss Pool, Yellowstone National Park; dormant, last erupted more than 30 years ago.
