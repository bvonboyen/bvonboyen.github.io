ðŸ’¡ Organisational transformation, risk & value management, with people and intelligent tooling
</span>

My core work sits at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management â€” combining the rigor of actuarial and risk modeling in wider context of financial risk. 

In either core actuarial practices, capital requirements, ALM, or value management. I am pushing the frontier with experience and AI. My project in sports simulation is just one showcase.

This site brings these domains together: applying principles of balance, feedback, and resilience across insurance, pensions, and real world domains.

If youâ€™re shaping transformation initiatives, exploring modern pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice â€” youâ€™ll find shared ideas, practical insights, my project portfolio and CV here.
