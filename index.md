ðŸ’¡ Organisational transformation, risk & value management, with people and intelligent tooling

My core work sits at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management â€” combining the rigor of actuarial practices and risk modeling in wider context of financial risk. In either risk control, capital requirements, ALM, or value management, I can push the frontier with my extensive experience and thrive for using new technologies, such as generative AI. 

This site brings these domains together insurance, pensions, and real world domains. My project in sports simulation is just one showcase, you will find other in either CV, project, or posts.

If youâ€™re shaping transformation initiatives, exploring modern pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice â€” youâ€™ll find shared ideas, practical insights & quantitative analytics, my project portfolio and CV here.
