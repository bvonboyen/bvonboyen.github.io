**Innovation in risk & value management — with people and intelligent tooling**

I work at the intersection of business transformation and quantitative risk management — combining actuarial rigor with modern tools and data-driven thinking.
My expertise spans pricing, valuation, risk control, capital, ALM, and value management, always with a focus on collaboration and emerging technologies such as generative AI.

Sometimes beauty lies in what remains uncertain — Abyss Pool, Yellowstone National Park; dormant, last erupted more than 30 years ago.

This site brings these domains together — from insurance and pensions to real-world modeling.
My sports simulation project is one showcase, alongside others in my CV, project pages, and posts.

If you’re driving transformation in risk management, rethinking pension design, or advancing analytics and AI in practice, you’ll find here a mix of [shared ideas](/#posts), [quantitative insights](/tags/analytics/), and hands-on examples from [real projects](/projects/), as well as my [professional background](/cv/).
