ðŸ‘‹ Welcome â€”

I explore how **business transformation** and **risk management** connect with two of my technical domains:  
**pension / ALM modeling** on one side, and **real-world sports modeling & AI experimentation** on the other.

This site brings these worlds together â€” combining actuarial structure with data-driven creativity â€” to show how the same principles of balance, feedback, and resilience apply across finance, risk, and sport.

If youâ€™re working in transformation, pensions, or analytics â€” or simply curious about intelligent systems that adapt to uncertainty â€” youâ€™re in the right place.
